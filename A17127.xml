         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.5.</note> that the ſpirit may be ſaued in the day of the Lord, not eradicatiue, to take away life, as the cenſure of the Ciuill power doth.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:7137:6"/>
            <p>So then, as the Church calls by the word and cenſures thereof, ſo the King calls, firſt, <hi>verbo,</hi> by his word or lawe Ciuill: ſecondly, <hi>exemplo,</hi> by his practiſe and example. His word is not <hi>Ite,</hi> Goe yee, and ſerue the Lord, but, <hi>venite,</hi> come, and goe with mee to ſerue God,
<note place="margin">Ioſua 24.15.</note> I and my houſe will be firſt; Hee is firſt in place before all men, that he may be firſt among men in the ſeruice of God: and the greater his power and graces are, the greater is his obligation to adore God, that placed him aboue men, and neere to himſelfe. And thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>Gladio,</hi> He muſt call by his own ciuil ſword, by temporal puniſhments, not ſpiritual, to which all Recuſants of all ſorts muſt be ſubiect: He muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel all men to enter into Gods houſe.</p>
            <p>Now there is a threefold <hi>venite;</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the firſt, <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulare,</hi> particular or ſingular in euery particular man; for man is a little World, or Citie, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in himſelfe. The <hi>ſpirit</hi> is to rule, and all the powers of ſoule and bodie muſt obey. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie</hi> muſt record all Gods bleſsings, and our owne dueties; <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt apprehend and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them; <hi>Will</hi> muſt chuſe, and loue them; and <hi>affection</hi> muſt deſire them. The <hi>ſenſes</hi> muſt bee ſhut vp, that they wander not, but aſcend and beholde; The <hi>eyes</hi> muſt ſee Gods beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not gad after vanities, and ſend teares as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors; The <hi>eares</hi> muſt attend trueth, not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; The <hi>tongue</hi> muſt ſound forth the Sacrifice of prayer, and praiſe; The <hi>hands</hi> muſt be lifted vp as an euening Sacrifice, to intreat pardon, and beſtow almes; And the <hi>knees</hi> muſt bee bowed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7137:6"/>that God who reſiſteth the proud, may behold the humble afarre off;
<note place="margin">Iam. 4.5. 1.

            <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Priuatum;</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the priuate call of the maſter of the family; which is another little king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and hath all the ſocieties of man and wife, father and ſonne, maſter and ſeruant in it: as the Kingdome is the great familie, conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny families, and the power of the King is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but <hi>Patria poteſtas,</hi> that fatherly power that was placed by God immediatly in <hi>Adam</hi> ouer all the families that iſſued from him. In which, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.7.</note> No deceiptfull perſon ſhall dwell in my houſe: ſo euery Maſter muſt ſay, No Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Gods worſhip ſhall reſt within my doores. If he will not go to Gods houſe, &amp; adore his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and receiue his bleſſed body and blood, <hi>Non habitabit in domo mea,</hi> Hee ſhall not hide his head in my houſe, if he be aſhamed to ſhew his face in Gods houſes. Our moſt religious <hi>Dauid,</hi> that ſits vpon the throne of this Kingdome, and ſuffers none to ſerue him, a King on earth, vnleſſe hee will alſo with him ſerue the King of heauen, may be a ſingular light, a patterne to all Maſters in this kinde. And ſurely hee can neuer bee a true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to a man in earth, that is not a deuout and religious ſeruant to God in heauen; If he be falſe to God, he wil neuer be true to him that is but the Image, &amp; repreſents the perſon of God on earth.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:7137:7"/>
            <p>The third is, <hi>Publicum,</hi> the publike call, when he calls all, who hath authority to call all; that is the Kings call: to which euery one that is a part or member of the great familie, and receiues protection and direction from him muſt be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; and not onely one family, or one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but as many families or kingdomes as are ſubiect to his dominion. All his Kingdomes muſt be obedient to his <hi>venite,</hi> and ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not onely in <hi>vnitate,</hi> in the vnitie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Religion, and worſhip of God, but alſo <hi>in vniformitate,</hi> in vniformitie of outward order and ceremony of Gods ſeruice, if poſsibly it may be; eſpecially in all the parts of my Text, of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Proſtration and kneeling, which are not ceremonies,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> but parts of Diuine worſhip; and for diſobedience muſt be ſubiect to his coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, who beares not the ſword in vaine.</p>
            <p>The Kings word is not, <hi>venite adme,</hi> come to mee,
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note> I will refreſh you: his office is not <hi>Reficere,</hi> but <hi>Ducere;</hi> not to refreſh vs, but to leade vs to refreſhing; that is proper to God, and Chriſt, who is both Shepheard and foode, Paſtor and paſture of our ſoules. Neither is the Kings word, <hi>venite per me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 14.6.</note> Come by mee, I am the way, and the trueth; that is true onely of Chriſt; For <hi>no man commeth to the Father, but by mee:</hi> and the King is not <hi>via,</hi> but <hi>Dux in via,</hi> Not the way but the guide of the way. But the Kings word is <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mecum;</hi> Come with me, I am both a ſheepe of the flocke,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.71.</note> and a Shepheard as <hi>Dauid</hi> was. Let vs goe together as one man to worſhip God.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:7137:7"/>
            <p>And therefore when God calls vs to come to him, he is our <hi>end:</hi> And Chriſt calls vs to come by him, he is the <hi>way;</hi> And the King calls vs to goe with him, he is our Chieftaine; And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Prieſts teach vs to goe in the way, they are our directors: And the Saints of God are our companions, and the Angels of God are our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants in this way to goe to God, <hi>Paſsibus &amp; mentis &amp; corporis,</hi> with the ſteps of our ſoules and bodies. Who wil refuſe to goe by ſuch a way as Chriſt is, vnder ſuch guides as Kings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are, with ſuch companions as Saints and Angels are, vnto ſuch an end as God is, who is life and bleſſednes it ſelfe?</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſtrepitus est in anima;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part. 2, 3.4.</note> ther's ſuch a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cry in the ſoule, that <hi>Dauids</hi> cry is not heard. The proud man calls none; for he cannot endure either ſuperior or equall, but muſt be ſinguler and alone. And the couetous man calls none; for he can abide no partner; and he denies that moſt to himſelfe, that hee gets from others: theſe in their ſilence, ſtop the cares againſt <hi>Dauids</hi> call.</p>
            <p>The voluptuous calls, <hi>Venite, perfruamur;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wiſd. 2.6.</note> to fil himſelfe <hi>voluptatibus,</hi> he might haue ſaid <hi>morbis,</hi> with pleaſures, or rather with diſeaſes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the worme of conſcience in ſoule. For while hee labours not to looſe the flower of his youth, he ſpends his life, and ends in that, which he hates moſt, that is corruption and rottenneſſe.</p>
            <p>The malicious calls for reuenge,
<note place="margin">Iere. 18.18.</note> 
               <hi>Venite cogite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, percutiamus, linguâ,</hi> and <hi>occidamus:</hi> Let vs <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe,</hi> ther's their conſpiracie: Let vs <hi>wound</hi> with

            <p>The Ambitious man calls to his owne facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which he cannot aſpire, <hi>Venite aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gene. 9.4.</note> Let vs build a Tower to clime to heauen: but it is <hi>Babel,</hi> a Tower of confuſion: and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that pleaſes all, torments all; and it lifts to the higheſt, that it may giue the greater and more headlong downefall.</p>
            <p>In this confuſion of calls, this Religious call, <hi>Venite adoremus,</hi> Come let vs worſhip God, is ſcant heard or regarded.</p>
            <p>In which, giue me leaue to ioyne theſe three, <hi>Adoration, Prostration</hi> and <hi>Kneeling</hi> together: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in trueth they ſhould neuer be ſeparated.</p>
            <p>And firſt I obſerue. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It is not ſaid, <hi>Venite, audia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> Come let vs heare, as thoſe doe that turne Oratories into Auditories, and Temples into ſcholes, and all adoration and worſhip into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Sermon: As if all, ſoule and body, were turned into an eare: or, as if all Religion and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that muſt be ſent vp to God, were onely this, to know the meſſage that God ſends downe by his Seruants.
<note place="margin">Luke 10.42 Rom. 10.17.</note> Hearing, indeed, is a good part of Chriſtianitie, but it is but a part: And faith comes by hearing, but faith, hope, and charitie, Iuſtice, and Religion, are not hearing, but the fruits of hearing: And therefore no man may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7137:8"/>thinke that he hath giuen God his due worſhip, if hee haue heard God ſpeake by his Miniſter: as if a man had obſerued the Sabaoth well, if they haue heard reuerently, as ſome Catechiſmes teach: much leſſe may they thinke, that they haue done all their duetie, that haue ſlept or tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out a Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or heard it, but not regarded it. For in this Pſalme, there is a difference betweene hearing and worſhipping,
<note place="margin">Verſe 8.</note> 
               <hi>Hodie ſi vocem eius au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diueritis,</hi> To day if you will heare his voice, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hearts. The <hi>Iewes</hi> heard Gods voice in the Mount, their <hi>Audire</hi> was not <hi>obedire;</hi> Their hearing was not obeying. They heard, but they worſhipped not God, but the golden Calfe: And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> after hearing, calls for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping; ſo, <hi>hearing</hi> is not all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Adoration here called for, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is <hi>Publica &amp; ſolennis,</hi> publique and ſolemne: and ſo much the <hi>Call</hi> proues, for it is of all the whole multitude of the people. And likewiſe the <hi>place,</hi> for it is not <hi>Praeueniamus ipſum,</hi> Let vs come before him,
<note place="margin">Verſe 2.</note> for that may be done in euery place; on the way, in the field, in the chamber, in the bed, in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and euery where, when wee are moſt retired and alone; but it is <hi>Praeueniamus faciem eius,</hi> Let vs come before his face, or his preſence, with thankeſgiuing. His preſence is his Tabernacle, or his Temple, the place which hee hath choſen to dwell in; And then, as the adoration is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and ſolemne, ſo it muſt haue all the parts, and dueties thereof performed to God.</p>
            <p>In ſolemne and compleat Adoration, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> theſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7137:9"/>two or three here mentioned, muſt be offered to God; Firſt, internall Adoration, that is, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of the heart, and inward worſhip: and next outward worſhip, that is, Proſtration, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, or bending of the body, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is a kinde of falling downe, and may well be included in it. In all adoration, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deuotion and ſacrifice of the heart in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and praiſe, is alwayes required and accepted. <hi>In ſacrificijs externis ſemper deſiderantur interna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug.</note> In externall ſacrifices, God alwayes calls for the inward;
<note place="margin">Prou. 23.26.</note> 
               <hi>My ſonne, giue mee thy heart:</hi> and God cares not for the outward, nay, hee loathes it, if the inward be wanting.
<note place="margin">Matt. 6.</note> If the heart doe not faſt and pray, and giue almes, the reſt is no better, then the ſtage playing of a faſt,
<note place="margin">Iſay 29.19. Matth. 15.8. Marc. 7.8.</note> or a prayer, or a Maundie: when our lips draw neere to God, and our hearts draw farre from him, God cryes downe the Sacrifices that himſelfe did inſtitute, with,

               <hi>Quo mihi multitudinem?</hi> and <hi>quis requiſiuit?</hi> Why doe you loade me with theſe loathſome and abominable ſacrifices? or who requires them? And of this outward Adoration, there is no doubt, but it is receiued and allowed by all, though not performed by all.</p>
            <p>But in publike and ſolemne Adoration, not onely the inward deuotion and proſtration of our ſoules, and the bending the knees of our hearts is to bee tendered and offered vp to God, but alſo the outward proſtration and kneeling of our bodies is required at our hands.</p>
            <p>And this externall worſhip of kneeling is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7137:9"/>by thoſe, that loue their eaſe more then their dueties, and therefore cannot endure to kneele, or ſtand, but muſt ſit at their deuotions, which is contrary to all diſcipline, and ſit at the Lords Table, as if they were equall gueſts with him, elſe wee ſhal bee Idolaters. Good God! Is it Idolatry to kneele at Gods Table, or at our prayers, when as no man without the brand of irreuerence, and ill manners, makes his ſuite, or askes a pardon, or receiues a great benefit from a mortall King without this bowing or kneeling? And the vniuerſall cuſtome of the purer Church was, that no man did receiue the fleſh of Chriſt, <hi>Niſi priùs adoret,</hi> but firſt he did adore;

            <p>SO then in this ſeruice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſoule and bodie muſt ioyne together for many reaſons. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is,

               <hi>Naturae totius debitum,</hi> the debt or duety of the whole man; for God created ſoule and bodie by his diuine power, and Chriſt redeemed our ſoules by the agony of his ſoule, and our bodies by the death of his bodie; and the holy Ghoſt ſanctifieth our ſoules and bodies in ſuch ſort, that our bodies are members of Chriſt body, and our ſoules and bodies are Temples of the holy Ghoſt;
<note place="margin">1.

The third is <hi>offenſio mutua,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> both ſoule and body are ſharers in the offence to God by ſinne, and therefore both ſoule and body muſt concurre in the pacification of God; our hearts muſt be broken and contrite by inward ſorrow, and our bodies and knees bowed, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that we are broken, poore and impotent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee come before that Phyſician, who cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth none but them that confeſſe their owne ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſeeke his helpe. So then, ſince wee come to Gods houſe to pacifie him, let our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be ſuch, that we ſtirre him not to more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and let vs euer hold this rule: <hi>Ingreſſus cum reuerentia, progreſſus cum adoratione.</hi> Let our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

            <p>Now,

               </gap>, let vs kneele, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, let vs weepe, may bee the cauſe of this varietie. And the coniecture is not improbable; for <hi>Dauid</hi> firſt ſaying <hi>Procidamus,</hi> let vs fall downe (which implies the proſtration of the whole body) it is not likely that in the next words he would adde <hi>Genu flectamus,</hi> let vs kneele, which is but a part, and included in falling downe. Howſoeuer, ſince Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſo often follow the <hi>Septuagint</hi> in ſome Textes that differ from the originall, I hope I may paſſe without blame, who make vſe of both.</p>
            <p>And ſurely,
<note place="margin">Verſe 1.</note> in this Pſalme, as <hi>Exultemus</hi> and <hi>Adoremus</hi> are well ioyned, let vs reioyce, and let vs adore; ſing for our deliuerance, and adore our Deliuerer; (for praiſe without adoration is to giue God our tongues, but not our ſeruice and obedience; and adoration without exulting, is to doe God ſeruice and not to giue him thankes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7137:13"/>for his benefits.)
<note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> So <hi>Adoremus</hi> and <hi>Ploremus</hi> are as well ioyned, let vs adore him for his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Lordſhip, and let vs weepe before him to intreate pardon for our tranſgreſsions. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration without teares, is to looke with the Phariſee ſo much on Gods graces and our owne vertues, that wee forget our owne ſinnes.
<note place="margin">Luk. 18.11.</note> And teares without inuocation is ſo much to looke on our owne ſinnes, that we forget the mercies of God that forgiueth ſinne, and ſo are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp in deſpaire. So that as we muſt praiſe God for his goodneſſe, and adore him for his greatneſſe, ſo we muſt weepe before him to waſh away our ſinnes, and deplore and preuent our preſent and future miſeries.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, if wee plucke away the vaile of fig-leaues that couereth our ſhame, rather then cureth our wounds, wee ſhall diſcerne that all our ſtate and being, is a lamentable and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being; For the naturall man <hi>Plorandus quia non plorat,</hi> is moſt to be pitied, becauſe he laments not his ſinne and miſerie, becauſe he ſeeth it not; as the ſicke man is moſt deſperate, whoſe woundes are paſt cure, becauſe they are paſt ſenſe; and the ſpirituall man, <hi>Non plorandus quia plorat,</hi> is therefore not ſo much to bee lamented and pitied, becauſe hee doth in ſuch ſort lament and deplore his owne ſinnes and miſeries, that his whole life is nothing elſe but a continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and contrition for his ſinnes: alwayes ſorrowing for his ſinne, and ioying in nothing but onely in this, that he is truely contrite for his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7137:14"/>ſinne. For why? The ſpirituall <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Satan with all his armie, will neuer be drowned, but in the red Sea of teares, which may well bee called red, for they are <hi>Sanguis animae,</hi> the blood of the ſoule. The fire of concupiſcence will neuer be quenched, but in this water of teares: and the ſpots, and deformities of the ſoule will neuer be waſhed away, but in the Sope or Lye of teares and compunction.</p>
            <p>Wilt thou then O wretched man, know the weight and greatneſſe of ſinne? Looke vpon the Croſſe of Chriſt, which this
<note place="margin">* Paſſion Sunday.</note> 
               <hi>day</hi> repreſents vnto thee, and there thou ſhalt learne, that none could beare it, but the Sonne of God: there thou ſhalt reade the depth of ſinne, that pearced not onely his hands and feete, but his heart alſo; in which hee offered vp prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong cries and teares that he might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the clamour of our crying ſinnes:
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> and Chriſt offered nothing for our redemption, but that which was neceſſary, and therefore teares muſt concurre as a part of our ranſome. And if our Sauiour wept for vs, the Redeemer for the redeemed; we haue much more reaſon to weepe for our ſelues: and let none be found ſo profane amongſt vs, that when the Sonne of God wept and ſuffered for our redemption, wee ſhould laugh and make merrie at our condemnation, as if wee were ſenſeleſſe of our owne confuſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt then hearken what Chriſt ſayth to vs from his Croſſe, <hi>Vide quae pro te patior,</hi> Behold, O man, what ſorrow Chriſt ſuffered for thee vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7137:14"/>his Croſſe; and let his ſighes and teares moue thee to compunction. And if this will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, then heare what hee ſayth in heauen to all impenitent and wilfull ſinners, <hi>Vide quae à te pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior,</hi> Behold thou obdurate ſinner, how great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches Chriſt ſuffers at thy hands, who by thy wilfull impieties doeſt crucifie againe to thy ſelfe the Lord of life; and then reſolue that as Chriſts hands and feete, and head, yea, and euery little pore and paſſage of his body was a fountaine of mercie that runnes in his blood, ſo thy heart muſt bee as a ſpring of ſighes and groanes, and thine eyes muſt bee as fountaines of teares to waſh, with <hi>Magdalene,</hi>

            <p>Angels and Saints haue no part in this diuine worſhip: becauſe, though they be in poſſeſſion of the Country, and haue more excellencie of nature, grace and glory then men haue, yet they haue no dominion; they haue <hi>Administrationem &amp; custodiam,</hi> adminiſtration vnder God, for they are miniſtring ſpirits:

            <p>Now before I come to the reaſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, it ſhall bee needfull to cleare one point, that much troubleth many weake conſciences: who out of an affected tenderneſſe, refuſe to kneele in the worſhip of Chriſt, for feare they ſhould commit Idolatry with the ſanctified crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But we are ſo farre from worſhipping or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring the bread and wine after conſecration, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, that wee hold it to bee no better then Artolatry and Idolatry.</p>
            <p>It is true, the hypoſtaticall vnion of the dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and humanitie in the perſon of Chriſt is ſuch,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7137:20"/>that diuine worſhip is due, and was euer tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the humanitie of Chriſt: <hi>Lignum nudum non est tactui inacceſsibile: atqui igni coniunctum, &amp; carbo factum, non propter ſeipſum, ſed propter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctum ignem, inacceſsibile fit: &amp; caro, ſecundum ſui naturam, non eſt adorabilis: adoratur autem in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnato Deo Verbo, non propter ſeipſam, ſed propter coniunctum ipſi ſecundum hypoſtaſin Deum Verbum.</hi> The wood, ſaith <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> may be touched of it ſelfe, but being ſet on fire, it cannot be touched; <hi>and</hi> the fleſh is not to bee adored for it ſelfe; but being the fleſh of Chriſt, and ioyned in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall vnion with the deitie in one perſon, wee adore not bare fleſh <hi>vt creatura eſt,</hi> as it is a creature,
<note place="margin">

Yea, we dare not but adore Chriſts manhood, becauſe it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably aſſumed by his Deitie into the vnitie of his perſon. But in the Sacrament there is no impanation, nor incorporation of his deitie with the bread and wine, as the Godhead dwelleth bodily with the manhood in his incarnation: and therefore it is moſt eaſie to make a manifeſt ſeparation between the adoration of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, as he is God and man, which is to bee done euery where; and the adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, where Chriſts fleſh and blood is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited and receiued by vs; which may neuer bee done to the Elements, though it muſt alwayes be giuen to Chriſt himſelfe: becauſe there can bee no ſuch vnion of the Godhead with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they ſhould make one perſon, that

            <p>And ſurely in this point, thoſe men muſt not onely be accounted <hi>neſcire,</hi> to bee ignorant and know little in point of faith, that cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betweene the worſhip of God and Chriſt; when wee receiue the Sacrament, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Sacrament or elements; but rather, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many &amp; ſo cleere reſolutions and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, they muſt be concluded, <hi>Nolle ſcire,</hi> that it is a wilfull and affected ignorance in them, that accuſe our Church of Artolatry and Idolatry, which ſo fully and ſo plainely profeſſeth that ſhe giueth adoration &amp; worſhip to God and Chriſt onely, to whom it is due at all times and in all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7137:21"/>places, and dareth not giue any worſhip to the bread and wine, to which it can neuer be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen.</p>
            <p>For why? Do we not daily worſhip God in his holy Temple, and yet not worſhip the Temple it ſelfe? The high Prieſt in <hi>Sancto Sanctorum,</hi> in the holy place worſhipped God before the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie-ſeat &amp; the Cherubims, but he did not worſhip either the Mercy-ſeat or the Cherubims, or the holy place. And we worſhip Chriſt at his table or Altar, and at the receiuing of the Sacraments, but we vtterly renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the worſhip, either of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar or Sacraments; We do not in imitation of the ſuperſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> vſe any eleuation of the conſecrated myſteries. Wee hold them, after they are bleſſed by the words of Chriſt, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend and ſacred myſteries, ſo conſecrated for vſe, not for Adoration; to conuey the fleſh and blood of Chriſt to the beleeuing ſoule, not to the <hi>carnall</hi> teeth or belly. Wee remember the words of our Maſter, <hi>Accipite, comedite, hoc eſt corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> and we wonder and admire the order: Firſt, <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,</hi> and <hi>comedite,</hi> take and eat, and then, <hi>hoc eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum,</hi> this is my body, and blood. And wee worſhip Chriſt when wee receiue his Fleſh and Blood: but we deſtroy not the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to make a conuerſion of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, or to annihilate the ſubſtances, the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſtill remayning and hanging in the aire, without any ſubiect: Neither doe we giue that <hi>rent</hi> and <hi>tribute</hi> of diuine worſhip to the creature,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7137:21"/>which is proper onely to the Creator: wee deale not with the Sacrament, as they of <hi>Rome</hi> do with their Images; which they adore <hi>perſe,</hi> and <hi>propter ſe,</hi> by themſelues, and for themſelues: Wee worſhip God and Chriſt, when wee receiue the Sacrament, and wee hold a moſt reuerend opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the holy and reuerend myſteries; but wee worſhip them not, neither by themſelues, nor for themſelues.</p>
            <p>And wee pray our Brethren, members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as wee are) to conceiue ſo charitably of their mother, that ſhee will neuer giue any the leaſt approbation of the worſhip of the Elements of bread and wine: ſince the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Papiſts, who brought in, not the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God at the receiuing of the Sacrament, (for that is much elder then the new doctrines of the Papacie) but the adoration of the Sacrament, are aſhamed and diſclaime this ſuperſtitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the elements or <hi>ſpecies</hi> (as they call them).

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7137:22"/>to Gods worſhip, but not properly the worſhip it ſelfe: For worſhip offereth and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſomewhat vpward to God, &amp; theſe do only bring ſomewhat downward from God to vs, and ſerue to feede the vnderſtanding, and ſtirre vp the affection: but the offering of our hearts and ſoules in ſome one kinde or other, that is indeed, the worſhip of God, <hi>Aſcenſus mentis ad Deum.</hi> When God ſpeakes or ſends to vs, <hi>Colit,</hi> he doth till and dreſſe vs, as the husbandman doth his field, or vineyard; but when we ſpeake &amp; offer to God, then we doe indeed <hi>Colere Deum,</hi> worſhip and adore God by our deuotion and ſeruice; in which reſpect the wiſedome of the Church hath ſo ordered that all the worſhip of God ſhould not be prayer and praiſe onely, leaſt too much inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould weary out the ſoule, as too much and too long bending the bowe doth make it ſlagge, and grow weake; in which reſpect rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is mixt with praying: nor yet all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God ſhould bee reading, leſt the bowe ſtanding ſtill vnbent, ſhould not ſhoot at all, and ſo ſend vp no prayers, not ſo much as ſhort eia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations into heauen: In which reſpect, all the Liturgie is not ſpent in reading.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is, that in Gods worſhip, theſe three might euer bee ioyned, <hi>Lectio, meditatio, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio;</hi> reading, as the foode of the ſoule; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as the ruminating and digeſting of it; and prayer, as the force and ſtrength that preſents it vnto God. <hi>Lectio docet, meditatio praeparat, oratio adorat;</hi> reading teacheth the duety of worſhip;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7137:23"/>meditation applieth and prepareth the heart to worſhip; and prayer offereth vp and tendereth the worſhip it ſelfe vnto God. Now the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a part of Gods worſhip: not as reading or meditation is: but as prayer, and the like, which properly offer diuine adoration to God. For why? The Sacrament is a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible grace; in which, as God offereth to vs his Sonne in his death and paſsion, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the holy Spirit; ſo wee offer to him our ſelues.</p>
               <p>In Baptiſme the Sacrament of Spirituall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the water waſheth the body; and the Blood of Chriſt waſheth the ſoule: there God becommeth our Father by adoption, and wee offer vp our ſelues, and our children, to be ſonnes of God by grace;

               <p>As in the Law, Circumciſion did conſecrate and ſeale the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to God; and the Paſſeouer did prepare them to the ſacrifice of God in the wilderneſſe; Yea, and this Paſſeouer is called <hi>Religio,</hi> Religion; What is this ſeruice? <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26. and <hi>Victima tranſitus Domini,</hi> ver. 27. the ſacrifice of the Lords Paſſeouer.

And this Sacrament may better be called an Act of Religion or pietie,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7137:25"/>and the ſacrifice of the Lords Paſſeouer, ſince that was <hi>Typus agni paſchalis,</hi> a type of the Paſchal Lambe, and here are offered <hi>membra agni Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> the members of the Paſchal Lambe.</p>
               <p>And this offering vp of our ſelues to him, is indeed the true and dayly ſacrifice of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, which being the myſticall body of Chriſt, cannot offer Chriſts natural body, which Chriſt offered once for all vpon the Croſſe; but offereth his myſticall body, that is her ſelfe, by Chriſt her high Prieſt and head, vnto God, as <hi>S.

               <p>To this I adde the confeſſion of the Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of kneeling at the Lords Table, which call it a will worſhip, and addition to the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God.

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that kneeleth at the inſtant of receiuing the Sacrament, performeth priuate worſhip, during the time and acte of the publicke.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore he that kneeleth at the inſtant of the receiuing the Sacrament, doeth that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Here it is aſſumed and confeſſed, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7137:25"/>of the Sacrament is an acte of publike worſhip, and kneeling is a priuate worſhip in a publike. So this firſt Propoſition is cleare and manifeſt, that this Sacrament is a principall part of Gods worſhip: wherein wee our ſelues, and not others for vs, with a full and free conſent of vnderſtanding and will, doe offer our greateſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to God, that is our whole ſelues, and <hi>Qui ſcipſum dedit, nihil ſibi reliquit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition is; In publike and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Adoration, the deuotion of the ſoule, and the worſhip, bowing, and kneeling of the body; the bending of the knees of the ſoule, and the bending the knees of the body; humilitie of the ſoule, and humiliation of the body, are required. And this is prooued out of the words of the Pſalme, where <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth to Adoration,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.6.</note> and Proſtration and kneeling; and by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Scripture, and reaſon, that both ſoule and body muſt concurre in the pacifying of God, as ſoule and body concurred in the offence of God: that ſoule and body muſt pay this rent and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their Maker, eſpecially in the Sacrament where they receiue their Maker; and the ſoule muſt informe, and animate the body in grace, as wel as in nature, and the body muſt mutually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the ſoule in the actions of pietie, as well as of ciuilitie: and to kneele to God with the body, and not to kneele and bee humble in ſoule, is to play the hypocrite, and to diſſemble with God; and to bow the knees of the ſoule in humilitie, and not to bow the knees of the body in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7137:26"/>like and ſolemne Adoration, is to be aſhamed of God, and to deny to profeſſe him before men.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is neceſſary out of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes; therefore, in the acte and inſtant of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacrament, in which wee offer vp our ſelues to God, we muſt kneele in all humiliation.</p>
               <p>It is true that in our Liturgies wee ſtand vp at the ſaying of the Creed, and reading of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and we ſit at the reading of the Pſalmes and Chapters: For, beſides that there muſt be ſome varietie in ſo long an action for the eaſe of men, who would ſometimes ſit, and ſometimes ſtand, and alſo an vniformitie muſt be obſerued in that varietie, the very geſtures fit, and may ſeeme to proceed <hi>Ex natura rei,</hi> out of the nature of the thing it ſelfe. For hearers do ſit, as the Preachers haue <hi>Cathedras</hi> Chaires, ſo the hearers haue <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellia</hi> Pewes or ſeats. And we ſtand at the Creed, for it is <hi>geſtus Confeſſorum;</hi> the geſture of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and ſouldiors that fight the good fight of faith, in token that in the ſtrength of this faith onely we ſhall ſtand in the preſence of God, and tread all our ſpirituall enemies vnder our feete: <hi>State in fide.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 16.13.</note> We ſtand at the reading of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: it is <hi>Geſtus expectantium,</hi> the geſture of thoſe that expect the glad tidings of the Goſpel of peace; as if we did with all cheerefulneſſe lift vp the eares of our bodies, as well as our ſoules at the happy newes of our ſaluation:
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.14.</note> 
                  <hi>State, ſuccincti lumbos.</hi> But when we pray, and offer vp ſpiritual ſacrifices acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt, then we kneele: for it is <hi>Geſtus petentium &amp; offerentium,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:7137:26"/>the geſture of ſuters and petitioners that deſire to receiue and of thoſe that offer, and deſire to bee receiued and accepted at Gods hand. And if in the receiuing of this Sacrament wee be petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the greateſt graces, and offerers of that Sacrifice that God will onely accept, that is, <hi>Nos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.14.</note> not <hi>Noſtra,</hi> nothing of ours but our ſelues; and God will not accept any thing of ours, vnleſſe he firſt accept our ſelues, though it might bee tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in ſome part of our prayers and Petitions not to kneele, yet in this great and moſt waightie part of our deuotion, and pietie, it is a matter of great waight and moment to kneele moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly, and piouſly before the Table of our moſt bountifull and gracious Father, who in Iuſtice doeth reſiſt the proud, with all ſeueritie.</p>

               <p>And the trueth is, that the Church hath euer offered true ſacrifices, and that in this Sacrament; but, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh,
<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Firſt then, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as the ſacrifices of the Law had a double reſpect; firſt, as they were offered vp to

               <p>This was the receiued doctrine of the fathers, and ancient Schoole. And that this offering of Chriſts death by way of repreſentation, cannot
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7137:32"/>be the proper externall ſacrifice of the Church, I proue by theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all externall ſacrifice is acceptable vnto God, for the internall ſacrifice of the heart, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum propter internum;</hi> as God firſt looked vpon <hi>Abel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4 4.</note> and then vpon his Sacrifice, not vpon <hi>Abel</hi> for his Sacrifice, but on the Sacrifice for <hi>Abels</hi> ſake. Firſt he offered himſelfe a Lambe to God, and then he offered his Lambe, <hi>de adipibus,</hi> a well choſen Lambe of the beſt and fatteſt, none was too good for God. Firſt God accepteth the man, then the gift, not as men doe, that ſo accept the man as they like and feele his gift. If then Chriſts Sacrifice be externall and offered by vs, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Chriſts Sacrifice muſt be accepted, for the inward Sacrifice of our hearts, and ſo we are more acceptable to God then Chriſt is: which is an horrible blaſphemie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> euery Sacrifice is accepted for the ſacrificers perſon, that is firſt accepted of God, <hi>Sacrificium propter ſacrificantem:</hi> therefore if wee offer Chriſt to God, Chriſts Sacrifice is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable for it ſelfe, but for our ſakes that offer it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the outward viſible ſacrifice is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament or ſacred ſigne of the inward inuiſible Sacrifice:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de Ciuit.

So then it is manifeſt that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7137:32"/>is no proper externall Sacrifice, but onely commemoratiue, and communicatiue of the all-ſufficient Sacrifice of Chriſt.

But, ſaith hee, <hi>Kemnitius</hi> admitteth that ſenſe to elude the places of the Fathers, in which the Maſſe is called a Sacrifice, <hi>Caeterùm haec accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio arbitraria eſt &amp; conficta,</hi> this acception is arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and fained: for neither the Scriptures, nor Fathers call this a Sacrifice, which is onely a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or commemoration of a Sacrifice: which I muſt referre to the iudgement of the iudicious Reader, to reſolue whether it bee not moſt plaine in the Fathers, and in <hi>Lumbard,</hi> and in <hi>Thomas,</hi> that it is called a Sacrifice, becauſe it is a memory or repreſentation of Chriſtes Sacrifice on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>This Sacrament is called a Sacrifice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe in it we offer vp and preſent vnto God, <hi>our ſelues,</hi>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7137:33"/>that is her ſelfe, and this is the daily Sacrifice of the Church.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">C. </seg>19</label> viſible Sacrifices are the ſignes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible Sacrifices; as ſounding words are the ſignes of things. Wherefore, as wee that pray, or prayſe, doe direct ſignifying voyces to him, to whom we doe offer the things themſelues in our hearts, which wee ſignifie: ſo ſacrificing, we know viſible ſacrifice is to be offered to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to him; <hi>Cuius in cordibus noſtris inuiſibile Sacrificium nos ipſi eſſe debemus:</hi> Whoſe inuiſible Sacrifice in our hearts we our ſelues muſt be.</p>
               <p>But the cleereſt and fulleſt place is in the ſixth Chapter. The true Sacrifice (ſaith S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) is euery worke done to adhere by a holy ſociety to God, referred to that end of goodneſſe, by which we may be truely bleſſed. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that mercy it ſelfe (that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Sacrifice) by which wee relieue man, is not a Sacrifice, if it be not done for Gods ſake; and although it bee done and offered by man, yet Sacrifice is a diuine thing, whereby man himſelfe conſecrated to the Name of God, and deuoted to God, in as much as hee dieth to the world, and liueth to God, is a Sacrifice; for this belongeth to that mercy that man doth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Our body, the ſeruant, and inſtrument of the ſoule, is a Sacrifice, if we chaſtice it by tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for Gods ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. much more our ſoule referred to God, inflamed with the fire of his loue, &amp;c. ſhall be a Sacrifice. Since then works of mercy towards our ſelues, and towards
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7137:34"/>our neighbors referred to God, are ſacrifices, and workes of mercy are done that we may be freed from miſery, &amp;c. it is certainely effected, <hi>vt tota redempta ciuitas,</hi> that the whole redeemed Citie (that is the Congregation &amp; ſocietie of Saints) <hi>Vniuerſale ſacrificium offeratur Deo per ſacerdotem magnum;</hi> may bee offered vp an vniuerſall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, by that great Prieſt, who alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp himſelfe in his Paſſion for vs, that wee might bee the body of ſo great an head, in the forme of a ſeruant; for, this hee offered, and in this hee was offered: becauſe according to this (nature) he is a Mediator, in this he is a Prieſt, and in this he is a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Whereas then the Apoſtle had exhorted vs, to offer vp our bodies, a liuing ſacrifice, holy and pleaſing to God, which is our reaſonable ſeruice of him: and that we ſhould not be conformed to this world, but reformed in the newneſſe of our minde, to proue the will of God, which is good and well pleaſing and perfect, <hi>Quodtotum Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium nos ipſi ſumus,</hi> all which Sacrifice wee our ſelues are; I ſay (ſaith he) by the grace of God which is giuen to me, to euery one that is among you, not to thinke of himſelfe more highly then he ought to thinke, but to thinke ſoberly or to be wiſe to ſobrietie, as God hath delt to euery man the meaſure of faith; for as wee haue many members in one body, and all the members haue not the ſame office, ſo wee being many, are one body in Chriſt, and euery one, members one of another; hauing diuers gifts according to the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7137:34"/>grace that is giuen to vs: <hi>Hoc est Sacrificium Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianorum, multi vnum corpus ſumus in Christo; Quod etiam Sacramento altaris fidelibus noto, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentat Eccleſia; vbi ei demonstratur, quod in ea ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione, quam offert, ipſa offertur;</hi> This is the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſtians, many are one body in Chriſt; which Sacrifice the Church doeth frequent in the Sacrament of the Altar, knowne to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; where it is demonſtrated to her (the Church) that in that oblation which ſhe offereth, herſelfe (that is the Church) is offered. In which paſſage of <hi>S.

And this is the vniuerſall Sacrifice of the Church. And this place of <hi>S.

               <p>I proceed to the fourth, for I ſhall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeake of this againe; and that is <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium orationis &amp; laudis,</hi> the ſacrifice of prayer and prayſe. And here I cannot ſufficiently wonder at thoſe, who would haue this Sacrament admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred and receiued without all maner of prayer or prayſe at all, according as it is barely deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be inſtituted by our Sauiour Chriſt a little before his death. As if the Church ſhould meete onely to heare a Sermon, that is, an expoſition of ſome Text, choſen by the Preacher (of which forme of Preaching there is ſcant a patterne to be found in all the word of God: and why then ſhould that bee called Preaching that is without Example?) and that ended, without any prayer, or thankeſgiuing, or preparation, or premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to proceede to <hi>accipite, comedite,</hi> take and eate, this is my body, this is my blood, and ſo farewel; for more is not to be found in the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And after the very Inſtitution there is further <hi>Hymnodicto,</hi> when they had ſaid Grace, or ſung an Hymne or Pſalme; ſurely that was thankes and prayſe to God for his graces and bleſsings. And it is worth obſeruation, that this forme of thankeſgiuing or Hymne, or Pſalme of praiſe, is principally, if not onely mentioned in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Sacrament, to ſhew, that though it may, and ought <hi>ex naturae dictamine,</hi> by natures rule and direction, be alwaies vſed to repay Gods goodneſſe and bountie with the tribute of our thankefulnes, yet it ſhould neuer bee omitted in this Sacrament, where if it bee not inſtituted, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is moſt cleerely recorded; and the greatneſſe of the benefit requireth the greateſt meaſure of thankefulneſſe.</p>
               <p>As for prayer;
<note place="margin">1.

I euer thought that our Sauiour, before he offered his all, ſufficient Sacrifice on the Croſſe,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> did <hi>offer vp prayers &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7137:39"/>with ſtrong cries and teares, and hee was heard for his reuerence.</hi> And his action being out inſtitution, we ſhould folow his ſteps, &amp; offer our prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong cries and teares before we did preſume to preſent Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to his Father, or receiue him our ſelues, or offer vp the ſacrifice of our ſoules and bodies, and the whole Church, which is the dayly ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Church. I euer tooke it, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles knew beſt how this Sacrament was to be receiued,
<note place="margin">2.

And in the 13.
<note place="margin">Act. 13.2.</note> of the Acts, the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> before they ſent out <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> they miniſtred, faſted, and prayed; here is faſting, and prayer, and it is likely it was not without the Lords Supper; for that which we reade <hi>ministring,</hi> is tranſlated by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> to bee ſacrificing, <hi>Sacrificantibus illis,</hi> and ſacrificing did ſurely imply the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts ſacrifice: and the word is <gap reason="foreign">

Theoſebia,</hi> that is pietie to God, if it be interpreted according to the expreſſe deriuation in Latine, may bee called the worſhip of God, which doeth chiefly conſiſt in this, that the ſoule ſhould not be vnthankfull to God; and therefore in the moſt true and ſingular Sacrifice, we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to giue thankes to our Lord God. As for the neceſſary vſe of prayer, heare <hi>Tertullian de Oratione, Neque enim propria tantum orationis offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia complexa eſt, vel venerationem Dei aut hominis
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7137:41"/>petitionem, ſed omnempene ſermonem Domini, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem commemorationem diſciplinae: vt reuera in ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione breuiarium totius Euangelij comprehendatur:</hi> It doth not onely containe the dueties of Prayer, the worſhip of God, and the petition of man, but alſo almoſt all the word of God, and all comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of diſcipline; inſomuch, that in trueth, in this prayer there is contained a breuiarie of all the Goſpel. So that out of this it may wel be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that there can be no act of diuine worſhip and Religion, without prayer. And ſurely ſince the <hi>Iewes</hi> that had no forme of Gods worſhip preſcribed for them, did frame to themſelues a forme of Liturgie, which they dayly vſed; and among Chriſtians there bee many Liturgies or formes of diuine worſhip, that beare the names, ſome of the Apoſtles, others of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which whether they bee theirs, whoſe names they beare, I cannot ſay, but ſurely by all mens confeſſion they are very ancient: It is a ſtrange noueltie, and indeed moſt monſtrous in the Church of Chriſt, that there ſhould bee no preſcribed formes of Prayer, and adminiſtration of Sacraments, but euery man left to his libertie, or rather licenſe to worſhip God after his owne fancie: and vnder the name of forbidding will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, to ſet out nothing but will-worſhip in the Church, and indeed as many will-worſhips, as there be wils, and ſo ſet vp Altar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Altar, and worſhip againſt worſhip, and make the Church that is <hi>acies ordinata,</hi> a well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Armie, or houſe, or kingdome, to bee no
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7137:42"/>better then Babel, a Tower of confuſion.</p>
               <p>And either the Church muſt haue power to ordaine and order Liturgies and Gods worſhip, or elſe I know not why any priuate man may bee ſo bold as to frame a worſhip or Liturgie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For if the whole Church haue not this power, where was it committed to any priuate man, or any part or member of the Church? And I know the Apoſtles deſired Chriſt to teach them to pray; And Chriſt taught them onely the mother prayer of all prayers, by which all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt be ruled and ſquared: and ſo it ſhall be lawfull onely to vſe the onely preſcribed prayer, that is the Lords prayer: <hi>when you pray, pray thus.</hi> And then I know there bee other preciſe Brethren that ſtand at their elbowes, and tell them that the Lords prayer was not made for that vſe, to bee ſaid publikely or priuately: but onely to be layd vp, as a rule, an Idea, or exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar to make other praiers by, and ſo it commeth to paſſe that wee muſt admit <hi>aut omnes, aut nullos,</hi> either all prayers that euery priuate ſpirit that will reiect the Apoſtles rule, and not be ſubiect to the ſpirit of the Prophets, that is the Church, ſhal frame: or elſe we muſt in effect admit no prayer at all, becauſe there is but one praier preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt, and that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort, that may be vſed. And if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the pureſt reformers (or rather de formers) it muſt not bee vſed, but layd by as a Patterne to faſhion the like.</p>
               <p>I come to the fife Sacrifice that I finde in the

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7137:43"/>that which of men is called Sacrifice, is a ſigne of the true Sacrifice; and then he applieth all this to Almes: <hi>Porro autem miſericordia verum est ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.16.</note> Mercie indeed is a true Sacrifice.

               <p>This is then plaine, that in the miniſtration and receiuing of the Sacrament, there are theſe fiue kindes of ſacrifices. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The Sacrifice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoratiue to Godward, and communicatiue to vs. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The Sacrifice of our ſelues, our ſoules and bodies, in which the Church offers the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body of Chriſt, that is it ſelfe, the Church to God by her High Prieſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt. 3. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a broken and contrite heart. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The Sacrifice of Prayer and Praiſe: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and 5. The ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Almes. And in the offering of all theſe ſolemne Sacrifices, humility both of ſoule and body is neceſſarily required: and therefore this Sacrament ought to be receiued with kneeling.</p>
               <p>And this will appeare the more plainely if we conſider the meditation and behauiour of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. And that will be the more manifeſt if we doe but remember, that which all ancient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies haue, and wee retaine, <hi>Leuate corda ad Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> Lift vp your hearts, ſaith the Prieſt; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple anſwere, Wee lift them vp vnto the Lord. <hi>Videte quid, &amp; ad quem,</hi> ſo S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerueth;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7137:45"/>Conſider what you lift vp, <hi>your hearts;</hi> and to whom you lift them vp, <hi>vnto God;</hi> and as God is pure, ſo be ſure to lift vp pure hearts, to him that is the God of all puritie. And it may paſſe as probable, that the bodily geſture of thoſe that come to the Lords Table was very humble in thoſe times, becauſe they called on them, <hi>Leuate corda,</hi> lift vp your hearts, though your bodies be humbled and caſt downe: and let not your ſoules be fixed on theſe ſacred Elements here belowe, but lifted vp to heauen.</p>
               <p>And ſurely if we remember, 1. the greatneſſe of God before whom we ſtand: and 2 the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſinne, which ſtands out againſt vs, which wee there confeſſe; and 3. the vileneſſe and baſeneſſe of vs poore ſilly creatures, duſt, and aſhes, that there preſent our ſelues, and ſtand out before him, <hi>Tantus, tantillos, tantum,</hi> ſo great a God and Creator as the Lord is, to whom none can be comparable, becauſe he is ſingular aboue all; and ſo vnworthy and contemptible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wormes, and no men, nay worſe then wormes, (for the pooreſt worme neuer ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and wee neuer did any thing but ſinne in his ſight;) and yet that ſo great a God ſhould ſo infinitely loue vs, vile creatures, and foule polluted ſinners, that hee ſhould giue the Sonne of his Subſtance for vs, the rebellious workemanſhip of his owne hands: whom hee loued ſo dearely, that hee ſpared not his onely, and dearely beloued Sonne, that he might ſpare vs moſt diſobedient and wicked ſeruants: that is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7137:46"/>loue aboue all loues, and meaſure without all meaſure. To which, when wee reckon, that wee are no way able to make any recompenſe or ſatisfaction, as hauing nothing to pay (for <hi>Plùs diligit &amp; priùs,</hi> he loueth vs firſt, and he loueth vs moſt) how can it be, but wee, which are the worſt of all Gods creatures, (for no creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low man is a ſinner, but man) when we preſume to ſacrifice and offer vp our ſelues (moſt vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and vnfit for ſo great grace,) to that God, who is holineſſe it ſelfe, and cannot endure nor admit any vncleanneſſe, when wee aduenture to preſſe into his preſence, and not onely approach to his Table as Communicants, but alſo exhibit our ſelues as Sacrifices on his Altar, but wee ſhould then (I ſay) tender our ſelues with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of ſoule, and humiliation of body; ſince both ſoule and body are there offered vnto him, in mentall and corporall adoration, and prayer, and praiſe, and almes, and the like; in which, the worke of the hand and the tongue, is but an idle ſound, without the word of the heart, and the ſoule; and the word of the heart is but empty and barren, without the obedience of the hand.</p>
               <p>So the perſon to whom we Sacrifice, and the perſon that offereth himſelfe a Sacrifice, require our humilitie of ſoule, and humiliation of body; this is the Sacrificers meditation, and other it ought not to bee: for <hi>finiti ad infinitum nulla est comparatio:</hi> there is no compariſon betweene God that is infinite, and man that is finite: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they differ, <hi>Pluſquam genere,</hi> more then in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7137:46"/>kinde; And therefore duſt and aſhes that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth before his Creator, muſt appeare in his owne kind, as duſt and aſhes, neereſt to the earth: ſince ſinne hath placed man in this Earth, in the vale of miſerie. Now, what is the behauiour of Sacrifices?
<note place="margin">Gene. 22.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſaak</hi> was a liuing and reaſonable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and no doubt, holy; &amp; therfore acceptable to God in Chriſt, as much as the ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man would permit: and he was bound, and layd at the Altar to be Sacrificed; there was neither ſitting, as if he were equall with that God that called for him to be Sacrificed: nor ſo much as ſtanding, either in his innocencie, or his hope, and expectation; And therefore being the type, both of Chriſt the propitiatorie Sacrifice, and of the Chriſtians <hi>Euchariſticall</hi> Sacrifice, wee, as bound by the chaine of our owne ſinne, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, and layd, and nailed (as it were) on the Altar of Chriſts Croſſe, with the nailes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, of deuotion, of prayer, and praiſe, and of compaſſion, muſt preſent our ſelues in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and behauiour of thoſe that are to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp as Sacrifices to God, in all deiection and humilitie of ſoules and bodies; kneeling with <hi>Salomon,</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7137:47"/>in an inſtant to be ſacrificed and die. And he was then to die the naturall death of the body, &amp; we at the Lords Table, die the ſpirituall death to ſin in mortification and newneſſe of life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no great likelyhood that hee then thought of the geſture and prerogatiues of a gueſt, and a table, as if he were equall to that iuſt and ſeuere God, to whom hee was to be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and ſo preſented himſelfe to him without all feare, and reuerence. <hi>S. Stephen</hi> the firſt Martyr, and therefore the firſt Sacrifice among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<note place="margin">Acts. 7.56.60.</note> prayed and kneeled: and though hee were partaker of the viſion of God, which is the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lambe, and that without Sacrament (for hee ſaw the heauens open, and the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of God) yet <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit vitam, ne deponeret obedientiam,</hi> he neuer layd downe his obedience, till he layd downe his life, but perſiſted in kneeling, till hee fell into his laſt ſleepe. And why ſhould not the geſture of a Martyr bee a fit geſture for a Communicant at the Lambes Supper, ſince both are Sacrificers of themſelues, the one in body, the other in ſoule and ſpirit?</p>
               <p>And this was in the time of Nature. Let vs looke on <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, concerning Sacrifices. In <hi>Leuiticus</hi> it is often repeated,
<note place="margin">Leuit. 1.4, 4.24.</note> that the Prieſt, when he offered for himſelfe, or the people, and euery priuate man that offred his priuate Sacrifice, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponet manum ſuper caput,</hi> He ſhall lay his hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the Sacrifice:

                  <hi>Vt renuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret proprietati, ſiue iuriſuo,</hi> That the priuate man might ſurrender vp all his right and proprietie that he had in the Sacrifice, when he deliuered it vp to the Prieſt, to be Sacrificed to God: 2. <hi>Vt poenas peccatorum in caput animalis transferret, quas inflicturus erat offerenti,</hi> That he might transferre the puniſhment of ſinnes due to the offerer, vpon the beaſt that was to be ſacrificed; In which it is manifeſt, that euery man that preſenteth his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at the Altar, ſtandeth as a condemned man ready to bee executed, that entreateth and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of God, that the puniſhment due to him by his demerits may be layd on the Sacrifice, that is vpon Chriſt that beareth our puniſhment and curſe vpon his Croſſe, and healeth vs by his ſtripes: As the death prepared for <hi>Iſaak,</hi> was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from him to the Ramme, that was hanged in the buſhes, that is Chriſt crowned with thornes, and nailed on the Croſſe. And he that feelingly conſidereth this ſtate, wil eaſily reſolue of the humble thoughts, and humble geſture of ſuch a Sacrificer as deſerueth the death that the Sacrifice ſuffereth for him, and deprecateth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his ſake, whoſe Sacrifice maketh atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſinnes of man. In this caſe when we thus condemne, and execute our ſelues, can any thoughts be too lowly, or any geſture too humble to entreat pardon? So this carriage of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7137:48"/>the carnall ſacrificer telleth vs, what our carriage muſt bee in the offering of the ſpirituall ſacrifice of our ſelues. Our prayers, that ſue for grace and remiſsion, muſt ſhew humilitie in ſoule and body, becauſe wee ſeeke indulgence to ſoule and body. And when we confeſſe we are moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to die in our ſelues, and for our ſelues, both ſoule and body; and deſire to receiue grace, not for our ſelues, but for Chriſts ſake; muſt we not teſtifie this vnworthineſſe with the deiection of both ſoule and body?</p>
               <p>Yea, our very prayſes and thankes for all Gods mercies muſt bee offered, with all outward and inward humility: ſince as it is in the ſecond Pſalme,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.11.</note> it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vs not only to <hi>ſerue the Lord infeare,</hi> but alſo to <hi>reioice to him with reuerence, cum tremore,</hi> (as the vulgar reades it) with tremor or trembling. For as the goodneſſe of God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth confidence and reioycing, ſo the greatneſſe and iuſtice of God, and our owne guiltineſſe and ſinne, cauſe trembling and humilitie. So our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſacrifice of praiſe and glory requires humilitie and kneeling: as the examples of thoſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (who being freed from all wants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neuer needing to pray, but onely to giue prayſe for their ouerflowing and fulneſſe of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the well head) doth ſhew:

               </p>
               <p>And ſurely the Goſpel, in the offering of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſacrifices, differs not in dueties of Nature and Religion, and chiefly in humility, which is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7137:48"/>
                  <hi>virtus Chriſtiana &amp; Euangelica,</hi> the Chriſtian and Euangelicall vertue, vnknowen and contemned by the heathen, and taught onely in the Schoole of Chriſt. And therefore our Sauiour Chriſt might teach all ſacrificers how to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, when hee entred into his agonie in the garden, which was the entry and beginning of his ſacrifice, (for there he did ſacrifice himſelfe, <hi>voluntate,</hi> in wil, as he finiſhed it vpon the Croſſe <hi>actu,</hi> in acte) <hi>Poſitis genibus orauit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22.41.</note> he prayed vpon his knees, to teach all ſpirituall ſacrificers to vſe the ſame kneeling in their deuotions, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſacrifices, which he began in the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory, and all-ſufficient ſacrifice for ſinne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, becauſe that wherewith God is worſhipped doth profit man, and not God, (for no man doth good to the fountaine, if hee drinke of it, nor to the light, if he ſee by it; and if man come to God, God is not increaſed by it, but man; and if hee depart from God, God looſeth not by it, but man:) it behoueth vs in all Gods worſhip ſo to carrie our ſelues, that our ſacrifice, and our ſelues, and our worſhip may be accepted of God.

               <p>So then, as Religion taught men naturall and ciuill dueties, to Parents, to Kings, and to Prieſts, and benefactors, to kneele, and to bow the head in reuerence, when wee receiue naturall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill gifts: ſo let nature and ciuilitie, as Riuers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne their ſtreames to the Sea of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whence they take their beginning, and teach men the dueties of Religion and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to bow the head, and the bodie and the knees with all reuerence and humilitie to God, who giueth not onely naturall, but alſo ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and diuine graces, and glory it ſelfe: nay,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7137:59"/>that giueth himſelfe, and his Sonne, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit for vs, and to vs, in this Sacrament. And let Fathers and Maſters on earth learne, euen of their children, and ſeruants on Earth, to do their duetie to their Father that is in Heauen. Thou boweſt and kneeleſt to thy Father, thy Maſter, thy Prince, thy ghoſtly Father in earth, who are but inſtruments, and vnder-agents of thy being, and conſeruation in nature, and grace, and therein doeſt but thy duetie: And wilt thou not much more kneele, and bow to thy Maſter, and King, and Father, and God in Heauen, who is the firſt, and ſupreame Author and cauſe of our naturall and ſupernaturall being, in grace and glory? If thou doe it to Gods Image, much more doe it to God himſelfe: for <hi>Gratiam,</hi>

<note place="margin">Matth. 26.20.</note> 
                  <hi>S.

<note place="margin">Luke 22.14.17.19.</note> in the 19. <hi>Verſe, He tooke bread:</hi> And in the 20. <hi>Verſe: Likewiſe after Supper hee tooke the Cup.</hi> And leſt any, out of the former wordes ſhould gather, that onely the Clergie ſhould taſte of the <hi>Cup,</hi> and the people ſhould be debarred of the Blood of Chriſt, becauſe, of the <hi>Paſchal Cup,</hi> he had ſaid, <hi>Diuidite inter vos,</hi> Diuide it among you; Of the <hi>Euchariſtical Cup</hi> he ſaith in <hi>S.

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26. ver. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Bibite ex hoc omnes,</hi> Drinke you all of this; all for whom my Blood is powred out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Iohn</hi> omitteth this <hi>Eucharisticall</hi> Supper, or the inſtitution of this Sacrament, as being fully related by the other Euangeliſts: but he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his riſing from Supper, and the waſhing of his Diſciples feete; And then hee addeth, So <hi>after hee had waſhed their feete, and had taken his garments, and was ſet downe againe; He ſaid vnto
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7137:67"/>them,</hi> &amp;c. So it ſeemeth this ſitting was, <hi>ad pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandum,</hi> to teach them the vſe of waſhing their feete, and to diſcouer the traitor <hi>Iudas:</hi> and then to fall into that excellent diuine Sermon, equall to that in the Mount, continued in the 14.15.16. and 17. Chapters. So then it is cleare, that they ſate at the <hi>Paſchal</hi> or common Supper: but of the Sacrament here is <hi>altum ſilentium,</hi> not one word in particular in all the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not cleare, that the word <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbebat</hi> in the Euangeliſts, doeth neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force ſitting: For why? <hi>Diſcumbere,</hi> in the ſtrict letter of the Text, muſt be vnderſtood of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſitting, vſuall in that Countrey at their Feaſts; which was partly lying on the ground, and partly leaning on one ſide, or arme, as the Poet ſaid, <hi>Strato diſcumbitur oſtro.</hi> And it is the more probable, becauſe it is cleare in the Text, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> leaned on our Sauiours breaſt, which he might eaſily doe in this lying, or leaning, but hardly in ſitting. And then, if the Apoſtles ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in receiuing this Sacrament, be a perpetuall rule, and patterne for vs, we muſt neither ſtand, nor kneele, nor ſit, but lye on the ground, or on pilowes, or beds, and leane as the cuſtome then was. So that it doeth not neceſſarily enforce <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum actionis,</hi> but <hi>actionem ipſam,</hi> not the geſture of the action, which is lying, or leaning, but the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe: that is <hi>Diſcumbebat,</hi> (i.) <hi>Coenabat,</hi> he ſate downe, that is, he went to Supper.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is yet a further difficultie, which is not eaſily remoued, that ariſeth our of the ſtrict
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7137:68"/>ſenſe of this word: For if Chriſts <hi>Diſcumbere,</hi> be <hi>ſedere,</hi> if this ſupping be ſitting, I would be glad to receiue an anſwere, how our Sauiour can bee excuſed from the breach of the Law of the <hi>Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer:</hi> For though it bee not expreſly ſaid in the Text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>Comedetis ſtantes,</hi> you ſhall eate it ſtanding; yet all the circumſtances of the Text are ſtrong, and pregnant, that they did ſtand at the <hi>Paſſeouer.</hi> The maner is deſcribed thus, the word <hi>ſic comedetis,</hi> you ſhall eate it thus, doeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the maner to be kept inuiolably, vntil Chriſt the true <hi>Paſſeouer,</hi> ſhould be offered vp. For this is the Law of the <hi>Paſſeouer,</hi> and an ordinance for euer, which they muſt teach their children: and therefore to bee kept not onely by them, that were at the firſt inſtitution, but to continue to all poſteritie; and not to be changed nor altered by the <hi>Iewes</hi> at any time, no not by our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, who came not to diſſolue one title of the Law, but to fulfill it, that therein hee might fulfill all righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, <hi>accingetis renes veſtros,</hi> you ſhall eate it, with your loynes girded; that was no way fit for ſitters, or leaners: for why ſhould they haue their loynes girded, that were to take their eaſe, and reſt? As if it ſhould be ſaid, that he that goeth to his reſt, ſhould put on his armour: ſince looſe garments are fitteſt for repoſe and reſt, and girt garments are fitteſt for them that miniſter, or trauaile; that they may bee light and nimble in the way, or in their ſeruice. So the girding of their loynes is a preparation to ſetting out in a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7137:68"/>for which wee are moſt ready when wee ſtand on our feete, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> when hee was led out of priſon,
<note place="margin">Act. 12.8.</note> was commanded by the Angel to gird himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Next it is, <hi>calceamenta habebitis in pedibus;</hi> you ſhall eate it with your ſhooes on your feete: and the Iewes cuſtome was to put off their ſhooes at their comming into the houſe,
<note place="margin">Luk. 7.44.</note> and waſh their feete, and then to eate or repoſe themſelues.
<note place="margin">Act. 12.8.</note> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> was bidden to bind on his Sandals when he was led out of the priſon by the Angel: ſo that it ſeemes they put not on their ſhooes vntill they were ready to ſet forward on their iourney.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is <hi>Baculos tenentes in manibus,</hi> you ſhall eate the Paſſeouer with your ſtaues in your hands; and nothing is more cumberſome in a feaſt, then a ſtaffe in ones hand; there is more neede of a knife, or a cuppe at a ſupper, then a ſtaffe.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, <hi>comedetis feſtinantes;</hi> you ſhal eate it in haſte, for it is the Lords <hi>Paſſeouer.</hi> In haſte? then there is no leiſure to ſit, nor is it fit to loſe ſo much time as to ariſe from the bed, or ground; ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is fitter for ſuch haſte, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lying or ſitting: and what ſhould vpper garments, girt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, do in ſuch hot Countreys, at a feaſt? or foule ſhooes to pollute the beds? or ſtaues in our hands, to trouble our eating? And when there is ſuch haſte that wee are in doubt to be thruſt out, if wee goe not of our ſelues, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in all reaſon is the fitteſt ſite, or poſition of ſuch poſters. And therefore though the word ſtanding be not in the Text, yet
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7137:69"/>all the circumſtances do conuince, that the Iewes ſtood at the Paſſeouer.</p>
               <p>And it ſeemes, the Apoſtle had a relation to this geſture of the Paſſeouer, in the whole armor of God,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.14.</note> when hee ſayd, <hi>ſtate ſuccincti lumbos,</hi> ſtand therefore with your loynes girded with the girdle of trueth, and your feete ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace; ſtanding is the fitteſt geſture for Souldiers and trauailers: ſo long as they ſtand, they are on their way; ſo the reaſon of the Text ſpeakes for ſtanding at the Paſſeouer, although the letter haue it not. And then ſince the Euangeliſts vſe the word <hi>Diſcumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi> hee leaned, or lay downe, as the proprietie of the word imports, of the Paſchall ſupper, this ſitting, or leaning, or lying, muſt bee ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or els Chriſt muſt be a breaker of the lawe of the Paſſeouer, which were great wrong once to thinke of him, that did many things that were not needfull for him to doe, that he might fulfill all righteouſneſſe.</p>

               <p>To this I adde one word more, The words of ſtanding, and ſitting, and the like in Scripture, doe not alwayes conclude a certaine geſture.
<note place="margin">Luke 7.38.</note> It is ſaid of <hi>Mary Magdalene, Stans retrò ſecùs pedes eius,</hi> ſhe ſtood at his feet behind him: Behind, for there her ſinnes placed her: and behinde him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if ſhe, being a Citie ſinner, that is a knowne and marked ſinner ouer al the city, muſt appeare before God her Iudge; ſhe would be ſure to put Chriſt betweene God, and her, that if God did ſee her, hee might alſo ſee and behold the face of his Anoynted Chriſt, and for his ſake be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to her. Now the word is <hi>ſtetit,</hi> ſhe ſtood; but it muſt needs be <hi>Prouoluta ad pedes Ieſu:</hi> ſhe ſtood, that is, ſhe fell downe at <hi>Ieſus</hi> feete, groueling on the earth, elſe ſhee could not waſh Chriſts feete with her teares, nor wipe them with the haires of her head, nor kiſſe, nor anoynt them. So ſtanding in this place cannot expreſſe her geſture, or her ſite or poſition, but only her comming to Chriſt: ſhee ſtood, that is, ſhee came behinde him to his feet, and waſhed them with her teares.</p>
               <p>In like ſort it is ſaid of the Phariſee and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>Phariſaeus ſtans, orabat apudſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 18.11.13.</note> The Phariſee ſtood and prayed with himſelfe, and <hi>Publicanus ſtans à longè</hi> The Publican ſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off: but the Phariſees ſtanding was rather <hi>in ſuperbia cordis,</hi> then <hi>Erectione corporis,</hi> in the pride of his heart, then the erection of his body: in which he ſaid, <hi>Non ſum ſicut caeteri,</hi> I am not as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7137:71"/>other men, or as this Publican: <hi>Bonus ſum,</hi> and <hi>ſolus bonus ſum,</hi> I am a good man, and the onely good man, no man is equall to me: But the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſtood afarre off, <hi>Longè loco, quia longè diſsimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudine,</hi> farre from God in place, further in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude, by reaſon of his ſinne. Hee ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off, not preſuming to come neere the Arke, but as he was loweſt in the humilitie of his ſoule, ſo hee tooke the loweſt place in the Temple for his body; And he that would not, or durſt nor, ſo much as lift vp his eyes to heauen, it is more then probable, that hee did caſt downe his body to the earth. And the rather, becauſe the Iewes cuſtome was to pray kneeling, not ſtanding, as appeareth by <hi>Salomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Paral. 6.13. Gen. 17.3. 1. Paral. 21.17. 1. Reg 18.42. Dan. 8.10. Luke 22.41.

So it remaineth moſt doubtfull, what geſture the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles vſed at the receiuing this Sacrament: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is the word <hi>diſcumbebat,</hi> he ſate or lay downe, vſed of the Paſchall Supper, but of the Euchariſticall there is nothing ſaid at all.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7137:71"/>of the body in that place: for then our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and his Apoſtles, cannot well be excuſed from the breach of the Law of the Paſſeouer.</p>
               <p>I come to the third point, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that is the geſture of the ſucceeding ages: which <hi>a poſteriori</hi> may bring vs to the Apoſtles geſture, which may be a rule vnto vs. And here I cannot conceale the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, made by the aduerſaries of kneeling, which carieth a great ſhew of probabilitie with it, but when it is well examined, it is not ſo much as <hi>veriſimile,</hi> a reſemblance of the trueth; The obiection is, that <hi>Diebus Dominicis, &amp; à Paſchate ad Pentecoſten:</hi> All Sundayes in the yere, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from Eaſter to Pentecoſt, the Chriſtians did ſtand at their prayers, and not kneele, in memorie and honour of the Reſurrection of Chriſt.

               <p>To the ſame purpoſe are cited ſome other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Councels and Fathers, to proue that which no man denies, that the Primitiue Church vſed to ſtand at prayers on the Lords day, and from
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7137:72"/>Eaſter to Pentecoſt, in remembrance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our bleſſed Sauiour; of which I ſhall ſay ſomewhat in their proper place.</p>
               <p>In which allegations, I pray obſerue a plaine repugnancie betweene the witneſſes, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that produceth them: for they doe directly croſſe and confound his purpoſe; for he maketh the geſture of the Apoſtles to bee in a maner eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to this Sacrament, in diuers reſpects. For why? <hi rend="sup">1</hi> the time, after ſupper; <hi rend="sup">2</hi> the element, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread; <hi rend="sup">3</hi> the place, a priuate chamber; and <hi rend="sup">4</hi> the preparation of the receiuers, faſting, or full, may and are changed by the practiſe of the Church, vpon good reaſon; but this geſture of ſitting, may not be changed for any reaſon: ſo it muſt be of the eſſence of the Sacrament. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is repugnant to the Law of nature to change this geſture of ſitting, becauſe it doeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with a feaſt or banquet, &amp; the prerogatiues of a table, <hi>Ex natura rei,</hi> out of the nature of the thing, that is a feaſt, a banquet, and a table; and the behauiour of gueſts at ſuch a feaſt. Now all the witneſſes produced; Fathers, and Councels, giue euidence for ſtanding, which is as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Law of nature, as kneeling is: and ſo this learned Logitian proueth ſtanding to haue bene vſed in the Primitiue Church, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Ergo,</hi> we muſt ſit at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>Beſides all the Fathers, and Councels, that mention ſtanding in time of Prayer, on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and from Eaſter, vntill Whitſuntide, doe approue of this geſture of ſtanding, as it were, <hi>Ex
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7137:72"/>priuilegio contra legem publicam,</hi> by the way of Priuiledge or priuate law, for a particular reaſon or cauſe, againſt the publike law of Prayer, which by conſent of all, ſhould be made kneeling, in all humilitie. And all priuiledges are derogations to the common Law, and rule of right. And therefore it is a very poore kinde of arguing, to diſpute, out of a priuiledge, to ouerthrow the publike rule of the geſture of prayer: For the Fathers decreed ſtanding for Sundaies, and from Eaſter to Pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tecoſt, <hi>non ex natura orationis,</hi> not out of the nature of prayer, which ought not to bee made ſtanding; but rather <hi>in honorem reſurrectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Domini,</hi> in honour of the reſurrection of Chriſt, which as that day, the firſt of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, wherein light was ſeuered from darkneſſe,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> as <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> reaſons, aroſe from the dead, and made that day to vs, the firſt of our Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; regeneration, or reſurrection from ſinne; wherein all the darkeneſſe of ſinne, and death, and ignorance, and types, and figures, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes was diſpelled, the power of Satan, the Prince of darkeneſſe was vanquiſhed, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to be vanquiſhed; and we were brought into the cleere light of the Goſpel, that hath not ſo much as a cloud of doubting, no, not of our reſurrection, to obſcure this glorious light: in as much as Chriſt, that died for our ſinnes, aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for our iuſtification,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.20.</note> and ſo became <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae mortuorum,</hi> the firſt fruits of the dead; and <hi>vbi primitiae, ibi alij fructus:</hi> where there are firſt fruits, there are other fruits; the firſt haue relation to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7137:73"/>other, or ſecond fruits that will follow. And Chriſt as hee aroſe <hi>ſolus,</hi> alone, neuer to die more: others that were raiſed by Chriſt, did riſe to die againe, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others did: ſo hee aroſe <hi>Totus,</hi> All Chriſt, that is, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt; and all that haue the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with Chriſt ſhall ariſe after him: the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full from the death of ſinne, in this life, which is the firſt reſurrection: and all men from the death of nature, in the life to come.</p>
               <p>And in this reſpect, the day of reſt, after crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in nature, was changed from the Iewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to the day of reſt, of Recreation in grace, and honoured with the name of Lords day, becauſe the worke of Redemption, from which Chriſt reſted at his reſurrection, is a greater worke, and much more beneficiall to vs, then the worke of Creation: For Creation giues vs beeing; but Redemption reſtores vs to that beeing, which was loſt by ſinne; to the well beeing of grace; and giues vs a right by the free gift of God to the beſt and bleſſed beeing of glory.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot omit this one thing, that the Author of theſe reaſons, cares not to make all the Fathers, and Councels, and the greateſt of all Councels, next to the Apoſtles Councell, the great Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> of 318. Biſhops, ſinners againſt the law of Nature, ſo hee may ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt kneeling: though therein he ſaid aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much and more againſt himſelfe, then indeed he doth againſt kneeling. For if ſitting at the Lords Supper bee eſſentiall to the Table and feaſt, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7137:73"/>banquet of Chriſt, and the behauiour of gueſts and coheires: the Fathers and Councels are guilty of the violation of this Law of Nature, who vſed and decreed ſtanding at prayer on Sundayes: And therfore as this man moſt weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would infer, at the Lords Supper alſo: which in thoſe times it ſeemeth was ſeldom, or neuer omitted on the Lords day; and ſo all his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as they teſtifie againſt him that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them, ſo they are tainted with the breach of the Law of Nature, which is in effect the Law of God, and ſo no way to be credited. And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny credit be to be giuen to them, certainely they are good witneſſes againſt him that produceth them, and therefore they doe in effect argue thus againſt him.</p>
               <q>Standing at Prayer, and the Lords Supper was in vſe in the Primitiue Church, by the teſtimonies of Fathers, and the decrees of Councels: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> Sitting is not the gesture of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants at the Lords Supper.</q>
               <p>To which if wee add, that the Fathers of thoſe times and Councels beſt knew the practiſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, whoſe example they propoſed to themſelues, as their rule and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one of theſe things will follow, that either ſtanding is the eſſential geſture, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles vſed, and not ſitting; or els the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councels changed the geſture of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, into ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, vpon particular reaſon of the reſurrection of Chriſt, and then the preſent Church may vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7137:74"/>as important reaſon of humilitie (which is indeed the leſſon that Chriſt taught, <hi>verbo &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplo,</hi> by word and example) change ſitting, and ſtanding, into kneeling; or that which is the trueth, the Fathers, and Councels, that vpon the particular of Chriſts reſurrection decreed for ſtanding prayer, might, and did (as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) vſe kneeling at the Lords Table; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the generall rule of Prayer, at all other times and occaſions: and according as they then vſed to do in the participation of thoſe great and reuerend myſteries of the Body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now among all theſe obſeruations, this muſt not be omitted in generall, before wee come to the particular, that all thoſe Fathers, who vpon particular reaſon of Chriſts reſurrection, ſpeake for ſtanding prayer on Sundayes, and from Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Pentecoſt, and at other times, according to the Common Law, or rule of prayer, require kneeling and humility with prayer; yet in the matter of this Sacrament, either they are ſilent, and ſay nothing; or if they ſpeake of it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect both ſitting, and ſtanding, and ſpeake onely for adoration and kneeling. And ſo here bee <hi>Testes,</hi> but not <hi>Testimonia,</hi> names of mute witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; whoſe depoſitions, or dictats, are nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt kneeling, but rather pleade for it, both by their ſilence, and their reaſon.</p>
               <p>For, concerning their ſilence, it is more then probable, that they, who for the reſurrection of Chriſt, and our hope and expectation of our
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7137:74"/>owne Reſurrection, did in a maner violate the Law of Prayer and humilitie, and ordaine ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Lords day; and from Eaſter to Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, as a teſtimony of our ioy and confidence, and expectation thereof, and diſpence againſt the generall Law of kneeling at Prayer; would alſo haue added the like expreſſe declaration in a matter of ſo great conſequence as the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is, and ſaid plainely, that for the ſame reaſon, we ought alſo to ſtand at the Lords Table, when we receiue the Body and Blood of Chriſt: ſince theſe reuerend myſteries require as reuerend ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and behauiour, as prayer doeth: becauſe in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we receiue all that which our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can aske, and receiue in this life, that is Chriſt with all the benefits of his death and Paſſion, and the holy Ghoſt, with all the whole traine of his gifts and graces; and the greater Gods gifts are, the greater ſhould bee our humilitie and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in receiuing them.</p>
               <p>And the Argument is good, <hi>Quod hominem,</hi> though it be defectiue in the Fathers ſenſe, which is this: <q>The Fathers and Counſels decreed for ſtanding at Prayer on Sundayes, and from Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Pentecoſt: But in the celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> according to Chriſts inſtitution, there was not, neither ſhould be now, any prayer at all, as theſe men ſuppoſe. Therefore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councels that decreed for ſtanding at Prayer on Sundayes, and from Eaſter to Pentecoſt, ſpake nothing of the Lords Supper, in which there ought to bee no prayer at all.</q>

               <p>So then the ſilence of the Fathers in point of the Lords Supper, is an argument that they ſpake onely of ſtanding at Prayer, and not at the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Come to the Reaſon, and it wil appeare more plainely: For beſides that priuate Lawes are <hi>ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti iuris,</hi> and therefore to be reſtrained to the ſtrict letter, and no further; And as the Lawyers ſay, <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam,</hi> the exception doth make the rule more ſtrong, and firme: the exception of Sundayes, and betweene Eaſter, and Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, concerning ſtanding at prayer, maketh the rule ſtrong, that we ſhould not ſtand at any other time, and the exception of Prayer on Sunday, maketh it ſtrong, that at other parts of diuine worſhip, whereof the Sacrament is a principall and moſt eminent part, we ſhould not ſtand, but vſe the geſture that the nature of the action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, which is humilitie, and kneeling. The reaſon which the Fathers giue, is the memorie, and celebration of the reſurrection of Chriſt, and the confidence that we haue, of our part, in the firſt, and ſecond Reſurrection. Now what is this Reaſon to this Sacrament, which is <hi>Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moratio,</hi> not <hi>Reſurrectionis,</hi> but <hi>Mortis,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, not of the Reſurrection, but of the death and Paſſion of Chriſt?
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.26.</note> The Apoſtle ſaith not, as often as you eate this bread and drinke this Cup, <hi>Annunciabitis reſurrectionem,</hi> you ſhall ſhew forth the reſurrection: but <hi>Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitis mortem Domini,</hi> you ſhall ſhew foorth the death of the Lord: So then the reaſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7137:75"/>is quite turned againſt this diſputer.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians did ſtand at praier on Sundaies, and from the Paſſeouer to Pentecoſt, vpon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reaſon, that is, for the memorie of Chriſts Reſurrection, and the ioy and confidence of our <hi>Conſurreximus,</hi> our riſing with Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.10.</note> and the power of his Reſurrection in vs; Wee come to this Sacrament, not to celebrate the memorie of Chriſts reſurrection, nor our confidence of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together with him, but in remembrance of his death, and Paſſion; in which wee muſt die to ſinne, as hee died to nature: Therefore, though we ſtand at Prayer to celebrate Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet we ought to kneele in all humilitie, at the receiuing of this Sacrament, in remembrance of his death, and Paſſion: for the Paſſion of Chriſt is as forcible to procure ſorrow and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie for our ſinne, that deliuered him to death, as the Reſurrection of Chriſt, is able to procure ioy and confidence for our redemption, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from ſinne, and death.</p>
               <p>And of the oxen and fatlings Chriſt ſaid,
<note place="margin">Matth. 22.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri mei, &amp; altilia occiſa ſunt;</hi> mine oxen, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are killed: and Chriſt was ſlaine, not onely that he might be to Godward <hi>Pretium,</hi> the price of our ranſome: but alſo that hee might to vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be <hi>Cibus,</hi> our food; Wherein becauſe man doeth altogether abhorre to eate liuing fleſh, our bleſſed Sauiour was put to death, that ſo hee might be the food of our ſoules. So then the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Fathers, which moued them to decree ſtanding at Prayer on Sundayes, and from Eaſter
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7137:76"/>to Pentecoſt, doeth proue <hi>a contrario,</hi> that when we celebrate the memorie of Chriſts Paſſion in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which mooueth compunction and humilitie, we ſhould then kneele, in token of our contrition, and humiliation, as they did ſtand in the ioy, and confidence of Chriſts, and their owne reſurrection. Whereby it appeareth, that the Fathers who ioyne teares, and contrition, and confeſſion, and prayer with this Sacrament, ment not to alter the humilitie in the receiuing thereof, though they change the ordinary ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of kneeling at Prayer, vpon Sundayes, and from Eaſter to Pentecoſt, for the ioy and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they receiued of our Sauiours Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we paſſed the example of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and his Apoſtles, and haue not yet found any ſolid proofe for ſitting at the Sacrament, but rather left it doubtfull, what geſture they vſed, whether ſtanding as at the Paſſeouer, or knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or lying, or ſitting. Now after the time of Chriſts Aſcention, vnto the time of <hi>Iustin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there is no Author produced, that ſaith any thing concerning the geſture of Communicants: only there is a coniecturall argument made to prooue ſitting. Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſate at the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, importe ſo much: In which aſſertion there is neither Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, nor reaſon: no Grammer; for the proper ſignification of theſe words is not to ſit, but to lie downe, as it is well knowen to all that are skilled
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7137:76"/>in the originall. Nor no reaſon: for if theſe words doe ſignifie ſitting, this <hi>Diſcumbere</hi> was at the Paſſeouer, as appeares moſt clearely in the Goſpels: and there might be great difference of geſture, at the Paſchall and vulgar ſupper, and the inſtitution of this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>It is confeſſed, that their ſitting, was both a ſitting, and a leaning: I rather take it to bee ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leaning, then ſitting and leaning: But I make no controuerſie about words: I ſay reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, the word of ſitting, or leaning, or lying is vſed of the Paſchall Supper, or the vulgar ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if they had any; but whether they continued the ſame geſture at the Euangelicall Supper, it doth not appeare; and it is more probable, that they did not, if Chriſt, betweene theſe Suppers did ariſe, and waſh his diſciples feete.</p>
               <p>Now for the practiſe of the Apoſtles, after Chriſts Aſcenſion, there are two other conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures vſed; firſt, it is probable that the Apoſtles departed from that geſture, vſed by themſelues, at the inſtitution: and this is not eaſily to bee gaineſayd; but it doeth no where appeare that they ſate, either at the firſt inſtitution, or at any time after the Aſcenſion. And all that is ſaid of ſitting, is ſpoken of the Paſchall Supper. So this coniecture commeth farre ſhort.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.21.</note> the Apoſtle compareth Chriſts Table with the table of deuils; <hi>You cannot partake of the Lords Table, and of the table of deuils:</hi> and this cannot bee denied; but withall, it doth not appeare by the name of a Table, what geſture
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7137:77"/>was vſed at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at the feaſts of Idols: and I thinke it not vnlikely, that their Tables were ſuch as were in vſe at thoſe times: and ſo it is likely to be lying on the ground, and leaning on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
               <p>As for the Lords Table, I conceiue by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, that there was more reuerence to bee vſed, then at either the feaſts of Idols, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common feaſts or eatings of Chriſtians; ſuch as their loue-feaſts were: for els why doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that there muſt bee an examination, and probation of our ſelues, before wee come to the Lords Table? Why doth he ſay, that they which eate this bread, and drinke this Cuppe of the Lord vnworthily, ſhall bee guilty of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and Blood of the Lord, and eate and drinke damnation to themſelues, not diſcerning the Lords Bodie? If this Supper may not bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without due probation, and worthineſſe, which was not required at the tables of Idoles, nor at the ordinary feaſts of Chriſtians: why ſhould any man preſume to make a compariſon betweene the Lords Table, and the tables of ordinary Chriſtian feaſts? why ſhould any bee ſo prophane, among Chriſtians, to compare Chriſts Table with the tables of deuils? As if he would haue vs in our comming to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to vſe no more reuerence then the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous heathen did at the feaſts of their Idoles. If Church geſture muſt bee ruled and ſquared out by the Idolatrous worſhip of deuils, why doe we not ſend Chriſtians to the Idolatrous Prieſts
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7137:77"/>of the heathen to bee tutored, and diſciplinated by them? Nay, if we muſt bee ſchooled in Gods worſhip, to carrie our ſelues at the Lords Table, as wee doe at our ordinary tables, why doth S.
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. verſ. 21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> reprooue the eating of Chriſtians, out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in ſuch ſort, that one is hungry, and another is drunker? what? (ſayth he) haue you not hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to cate and drinke in? or deſpiſe you the Church of God, and ſhame them that haue not? The Church was for the Lords Table, the houſe was for ordinarie tables; they that eate in the Church, in ſuch irreuerend faſhion as they eate in their priuate houſes, they deſpiſe the Church of God. Then ſurely there was more reuerence to bee vſed at the Lords Table, then at ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tables; there muſt be a diſcerning of the Lords Bodie, from common eatings: and how ſhal this diſcerning be diſcerned? by the inward affection and deuotion of the heart, which is knowen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God? This S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not reprooue in the Corinthians, for hee was not the ſearcher of the heart and reines: therefore he muſt diſcerne their hearts by their hands, and their intentions by their actions, that is, by their geſtures: and ſo it will neceſſarily follow, that whereas at common tables there was ſocietie and equalitie, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ciuill reuerence, (which muſt not bee denied at common eatings) betweene the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and his gueſts; yet at the Lords Table there muſt be more then ciuill reuerence, and that muſt neceſſarily bee diuine worſhip to God, who makes this Feaſt, with whom there can bee no
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7137:78"/>equalitie at all, as hereafter more at large ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the authorities that are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this cauſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt that is produced is <hi>Dionyſius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who liued about 250. yeeres after Chriſt, not firſt in order of the time, but firſt in the order that this Author conceiues, though erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly; for he placeth him <hi>Anno</hi> 157. before <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian:</hi> I thinke becauſe hee onely commeth neere to the purpoſe, he placed him firſt; for he onely ſpeaketh of the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Enſeb. l.</hi> 7. <hi>hiſt. c.</hi> 9.</note> the reſt of prayer. Hee writes to <hi>Xistus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning one that deſired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization, becauſe hee had been baptized, as hee ſaid, with a Baptiſme full of impietie, and blaſphemie; whom hee durſt not rebaptize, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though troubled in his minde about it, becauſe his often communicating did ſuffice him, who had heard thankſgiuing in the Church, and ſaid Amen with others. <hi>Menſae aſtitiſſet,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hee ſtood at the Table, and reached out his hand to take that holy foode: This phraſe, <hi>Hee ſtood at the Table,</hi> in this mans conceit, prooues ſtanding to bee the geſture of Communicants in that age. But if hee had conſidered the proprietie of the word that ſignifieth, <hi>Propè vel iuxtaſistere, vel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe,</hi> to be preſent, or neere to the Table, hee might haue conceiued, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the geſture of Communicants, but of his preſence at the Communion: For <hi>Ruffinus</hi> reades it thus; <hi>Quod tamdiu in Sacramentis nobis
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7137:78"/>iamparticeps fuerit:</hi> Becauſe he had bene partaker of the Sacraments ſo long with vs. And againe, <hi>Neque audet vltra ad menſam Dominica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accedere,</hi> he dares not come any more to the Lords Table: ſo <hi>Ruffinus</hi> vnderſtandeth <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of the action of receiuing, not of the geſture. And the force of his anſwere is not placed in his ſtanding, but in his preſence, and partaking of the Communion: he need not to be rebaptized, and begin at rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; Why? becauſe he had often receiued the Communion, the Sacrament of encreaſe and perfection.</p>
               <p>This authoritie is grounded in Grammer, or rather Criticiſme, not in reaſon; which I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceiue, becauſe I find the like words vſed by <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his 61.

As for <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> he is cleare, that we ſhould kneele at the Communion, as his following words <hi>ad populum Antiochenum</hi> ſhew; <hi>At pura ſunt, igitur adora, &amp; communica,</hi> but thy garments are pure, therefore adore, that is kneele, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate: as he elſewhere ſheweth, by the compariſon of the Wiſe men, that kneeled to our Sauiour in the manger, as I wil ſhew in his place.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, ſaith this Author out of <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>

               <p>But in the word of ſtation, he is egregiouſly deceiued: For, ſaith he, <hi>Tertullian de oratione</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the word <hi>ſtatio,</hi> ſtanding, for prayer; and calleth the Lords days, <hi>Dies ſtationum,</hi> the dayes of ſtation, or ſtanding; For it is cleere in <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that <hi>Dies ſtationum,</hi> the dayes of ſtation were neuer made on the Sundayes; and his words are plaine,

Chapter, which I accept of, though I finde it not there; that kneeling is a geſture of a Penetentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of ſuch outward humiliation, as is wholy diſagreeable with the ſolemnitie of reioycing, on the Lords day. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> indeed mentioneth reſt and reioycing, and then addeth, <hi>Propter hoc:</hi> for this cauſe we faſt not, but ſtand: wherin I ſee no reaſon but a man may haue reſt, and reioyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſts Reſurrection, and yet haue ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and contrition, and humiliation for his ſinne, without which no man can bee duely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7137:84"/>for the Lords Table. And as ſtanding at prayer may agree with reſt and reioyceing, ſo compunction and humiliation is moſt ſutable to a Penetentiarie; and all Communicants muſt firſt be penitents, and examine themſelues, and diſcerne the Lords body, before they receiue it. And therefore they that reioyce at Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and ſo ſtand, muſt bee contrite, and humble, and ſo kneele when they participate of Chriſts Body and Blood. And I preſume it will be plaine, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> required kneeling at the receiuing of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And here I pray you obſerue, what a vaſt <hi>hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> gulfe or ſpace, this Author maketh; From <hi>S.

Augustine,</hi> though hee allow the cuſtome of the Church, in ſtanding at prayers for certaine dayes, yet hee doubteth of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the decree of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell in that caſe,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7137:84"/>who liued about an hundred yeeres after the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> decree, I ſhould haue thought it had bin quite diſcuſtomed, long before <hi>Anſelme,</hi> but that it was held in life by ſome after Councels: yet from the laſt Councell vnto <hi>Anſelme,</hi> there paſſed about 300. yeeres, in which time there is not found one word in fauour of ſtanding at prayer.</p>
               <p>Now this Author from <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> cites no other, till he come to <hi>Anſelme,</hi> who liued neere 700. yeeres after him: yet this geſture of ſtanding is mentioned in <hi>Beda,</hi> and <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> and I finde it in <hi>Hugo de ſancto Victore,</hi> who liued neere 60. yeeres after <hi>Anſelme.</hi> But in this I obſerue; That this ſtanding was not, during all the Liturgie, but onely at a part; not at the <hi>Eucharist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Hugo de ſancto Victore</hi> obſerueth, that they ſtood at prayer, vntill the Collect, <hi>Domine Deus Pater, qui nos ad principium:</hi> O Lord God, and heauenly Father, which haſt ſafely brought vs to the beginning of this day: which is the laſt Collect in our firſt Seruice, in the Liturgie of the Church of England. I ſay the firſt Seruice, for it is ſtill in vſe in ſome Cathedral Churches in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: they haue the firſt Seruice on the Sunday morning, and then goe out for a time, and come in againe, and beginne at the Lords Prayer, ten Commandements, or ſecond Seruice, and ſo goe to the Communion: and the firſt Seruice is ſaid in the ordinary place, but at the ſecond the Prieſt goeth vp to the Communion Table, or Altar, and there proceedeth to the Communion. And in ſome Churches, the Sermon is betweene the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7137:85"/>firſt and ſecond Seruice. Yea in ſome Pariſh Churches, though they goe not out, to come in againe, yet they make a pauſe, and knoll a Bell, to giue warning of the beginning of the ſecond Seruice.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7137:85"/>many in number, which both Prieſt and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all ſinners, ſay proſtrate or kneeling: and here is <hi>oratio,</hi> one prayer, in the ſingular, whether the Lords prayer, or ſome other ſingular prayer, made for the celebration of the Reſurrection, I cannot reſolue, but muſt leaue it to the Readers more mature iudgement. But the argument is very probable, becauſe <hi>Hugo</hi> deſigneth ſome prayers that were ſayd ſtanding, which are no part of the Communion; therefore the ſpeciall prayers, vſed at the receiuing of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> were not ſaid ſtanding, but kneeling; according as the Deacon called to the people; <hi>Flectamus genua,</hi> Let vs kneele; and as wee in our Liturgie ſtil obſerue at the confeſsion, before the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> Make your humble confeſsion to Almightie God, meekely kneeling on your knees.</p>

                  <hi>Inſtare in oratione,</hi> and <hi>astare ad orationem,</hi> to bee inſtant in prayer, and to ſtand in prayer, are of one extent, to bee vſed at all times, Sundayes, and other dayes: and this watching in prayer, with thankeſgiuing, is as much required in knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as in ſtanding: and wee muſt ſhut out all worldly and fleſhly thoughts in all our prayers. Wherein, becauſe <hi>Anſelme</hi> doth not mention this priuate law of ſtanding at prayers on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and from Eaſter vntill Pentecoſt, as the Fathers doe, but ſpake generally of Prayer; wee muſt vnderſtand him to ſpeake according vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law of prayer, of that poſition, which prayer in the nature thereof doth require, which is kneeling; of which <hi>Anſelme</hi> elſewhere ſpeakes very largely, leſt wee ſeeme to make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now the ſame <hi>Anſelme,</hi> vpon the words, <hi>Flecto genua, Epheſ.</hi> 3. For this cauſe I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Ieſus; <hi>Per flectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem genuum, intelligimus humilitatem ſupplicantis: nam ad hoc ſolent in oratione flecti genua, vt humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas interior denotetur, &amp; humiliori ſupplicatione af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus orationis commendetur:</hi> By the bowing of the knees, we vnderſtand the humilitie of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant: for to this end knees are bowed in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that inward humilitie may be declared, and the affection of prayer is commended by the more humble ſupplication. And then he varieth the words thus, I bow my knees, that is, I ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate humbly in prayers; ſo that humble prayer, and kneeling at prayer, are equiualent with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme.</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:7137:86"/>And humble prayer is effectuall prayer: and then, as it is true, <hi>humilis oratio penetrat coelos;</hi> humble prayer pearceth heauen; ſo kneeling prayer muſt haue the ſame effect, that it entreth heauen, and is accepted of God.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the Councels. And firſt,
<note place="margin">Cap. 20.</note> the Fathers of the Nicene Councel decreed for ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at prayer on the Sundayes, and the dayes of Pentecoſt, but giue not their reaſon, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before had done, but they labour for the vniformitie of one cuſtome in the external forme of Gods worſhip: which was not a forme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the word of God, nor agreeable to the nature of prayer, but yet decreed by thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe names are glorious in Gods Church vnto the worlds end. And therefore they thought they had authority to ordaine, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, and confirme externall worſhip, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in Gods ſeruice, and thoſe repugnant to the nature of the thing they had in hand; which if they grant to bee vſed in the Communion, as they affirme without proofe, either theſe Patrons of ſtanding, muſt confeſſe the Churches power to be ſo great, to alter the geſture vſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which is eſſentiall to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe, and vpon priuate reaſon, to place another in the ſtead thereof, repugnant to the nature of prayer; or elſe, they muſt lay a foule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion vpon that moſt reuerend and venerable Synod, of greateſt note and authoritie, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie hath knowen, ſince the Apoſtles liued; that is, that they violated an eſſentiall part of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7137:87"/>this Sacrament, when they turned ſitting into ſtanding at prayer, and miniſtration of this great myſtery.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning this cuſtome: it was not begun by thoſe Nicene Fathers, but reduced to vnitie and vniformitie, (a thing which theſe ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot endure, but deſire to be left at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, enery man to vſe what geſture and faſhion he likes beſt) but it was, as all cuſtomes are, and ſhould bee, ſo ancient, that it was beyond all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of man: (for how can that be called a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, whoſe beginning is knowen by them that ſtyle it by the name of a cuſtome?) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no one witneſſe, or Father produced for ſtanding at prayer, ſpeakes other of it, then as of a receiued cuſtome, <hi>In moribus hominum,</hi> in the manners of men before his time. <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> is the firſt: he ſaith, wee riſe vp and pray, hee ſayth onely <hi>ſurgimus,</hi> wee ariſe, it is <hi>factum,</hi> a thing not now begun, but done before; not <hi>decretum,</hi> not now decreed to be done. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayth, <hi>Nefas ducimus,</hi> wee hold it vnlawfull to kneele at ſuch times; this cuſtome was growne olde of great ſtrength, not to be reſiſted, it was become natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnto them: and preſcription was another law to them: to croſſe which cuſtome hee ſayd, we hold it vnlawfull. So though this age teſtifie of it, yet muſt it bee much elder, and take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Apoſtles, or ſucceeding Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall men. And this cuſtome is onely confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and decreed in this Nicene Councell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it ſeemes, Chriſtians liked not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7137:87"/>the reaſon of it; for there may be ioy in him that kneeleth, as well as ſorrow in him that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: ſo though it were ancient, and had ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reaſon for it, yet it ſeemeth, becauſe there was greater reaſon for kneeling then for ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it began to grow out of vſe, and that was the cauſe of this decree.</p>
               <p>Now that this decree for ſtanding reacheth onely to Praier, and not to the Sacrament, it may appeare by another decree, not of the firſt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> hath: but thoſe other ſet out by <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus l.</hi> 3. wherein, becauſe in thoſe times it ſeemed they were too humble at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, they thus decree, <hi>Ne humiliter intentiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ad propoſitum panem &amp; poculum, ſed attollentes mentes, fide intelligamus ſitum in ſacra illa menſa, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num illum Dei, tollentem peccata mundi, incruentè à Sacerdotibus immolatum, &amp; pretioſum ipſius corpus &amp; ſanguinem nos verè ſumentes, credere haec eſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectionis noſtrae Symbola:</hi> Let vs not be humbly intentiue to the Bread, and Cup ſet before vs, but lifting vp our minds, let vs by faith vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinnes of the world, and is ſlaine vnbloodily by the Prieſts, is ſet vpon that holy Table, and that wee truely receiuing his pretious Body and Blood, doe beleeue thoſe to bee the Symbols of our Reſurrection. It ſeemeth ſomewhat was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, that the Councell by this Canon would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe; and it muſt be in the humble intending to the Elements; That muſt be either in the inward thought, and opinion of the Bread and Wine,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7137:88"/>and then the Councell ſhould not haue ſaid, <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militèr intenti,</hi> but <hi>reuerentèr intenti,</hi> not humbly intentiue, as if they thought too baſely or hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of them, but rather reuerently intentiue, as thinking too highly of the Elements or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or elſe it muſt be in the outward carriage and behauiour, and then the Canon would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe the outward geſture, which might incline vnto too much honour of the Elements, and ſo detract from the humble reuerence that was due to God, whom we doe worſhip and adore more ſpecially in this Sacrament. And ſo it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that they were too humble at the receipt of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and therefore receiued it with kneeling; for ſo much the Canon doeth imply, <hi>à contrario ſenſu, Ne humilitèr intenti ſimus ad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum panem &amp; poculum,</hi> Let vs not bee humbly intentiue to the Bread and Cup ſet vpon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Ergo humilitè intenti erga Deum qui corpore &amp; ſanguine agni nos paſcit,</hi> Therefore let vs be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intentiue towards God, who feedeth vs with the Body and Blood of the Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</p>
               <p>The next is the ſixt Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non 20. which is no other then the former of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell in effect; <hi>Quoniam ſunt quidam qui die Dominico, &amp; in diebus Pentecoſtes, flectunt genua, placuit de hoc ſanctae &amp; magnae Synodo, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos in omnibus locis conſonantèr &amp; conſentientèr ſtantes, Deum orare debere;</hi> Becauſe there be ſome that bow their knees vpon the Lords day, and the dayes of Pentecoſt, it hath pleaſed this ſacred
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7137:88"/>and great Synod in this point, that all, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to pray to God ſtanding, conſonantly, and with one conſent. In which I obſerue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that the continuance of this geſture at this time began to decay; belike, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined from the naturall geſture of prayer, which ſhould be kneeling with all humilitie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they in <hi>Africa</hi> made this Canon to keepe life in it. For, as it is ſaid before in <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> there was ſome doubt of the obſeruation of it, in all places; and in this Councell it is laſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned plainely, and affirmatiuely. And after <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> there is no author produced vntill <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme.</hi> And after this Councell, there is little mention of it in plaine termes, vntill the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Turon,</hi> about Anno 800. except the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſext</hi> Councel of Conſtantinople; and theſe wil appeare to be but cold teſtimonies for it.</p>
               <p>To the third, which is the Roman Councel, held vnder <hi>Hilarius</hi> the Pope, there needeth no anſwere, for they doe onely decree the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons in generall words; without any particular mention of ſtanding at Prayer on the Lords day, &amp; in the dayes of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt. <hi>Vt diuinae legis praecepta, &amp; Nicenorum Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num conſtituta,</hi> that the precepts of the diuine Law, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutions of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, be not violated. This is all, and it may be this 20. Canon about ſtanding at Prayer, was not much thought of in particular, by thoſe 48. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in that Councell.</p>
               <p>The Canons of the Councell called <hi>Quini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſextum,</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:7137:89"/>which were made at Conſtantinople, mention and approue this ſtanding at Prayer, and withall limit it, Canon 90. that <hi>Poſt veſperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ingreſſum,</hi> After the euening ingreſſe to the Altar on Saturday, to the next euening, no man ſhould kneele, and after that euening they ſhould kneele againe. In which that appeareth which was before ſaid, that this was but a diſpenſation, or a priuate Law, which doth derogate from the publike, vpon ſpeciall reaſon, and therefore it did eaſily returne to the prime inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt Councell, is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Turon,</hi> vnder <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and <hi>Leo</hi> the third: I will ſet it downe at large. <hi>Sciendumeſt, quòd exceptis diebus Dominicis, &amp; illis feſtiuitatibus, quibus &amp; vniuerſalis Eccleſia ob recordationem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicae reſurrectionis, ſolet ſtando orare, fixis in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram genibus, ſupplicitèr Dei clementiam nobis profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam, noſtrorum<expan>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7137:89"/>ground: of which kneeling in prayer) our Lord himſelfe gaue vs an example in the Goſpel: and the Acts of the Apoſtles are witneſſe, that S. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Martyr, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> did the like. By which it is giuen to vnderſtand, that Chriſtians ought (not may) caſt themſelues humbly on the earth, leſt it be ſaid to them, Why art thou proud, that art but duſt and aſhes? The Canon doth not ſay, <hi>Nefas ducimus,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> did, we hold it vnlawfull to pray kneeling on Sundayes, and in the dayes of Pentecoſt, but reſolutely decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for kneeling in prayer, and by way of priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely permitteth ſtanding at prayer on the Lords day, and other feſtiuities, celebrated in the Church, by way of exception out of the generall rule. Wherby it appeareth, that the generall rule is, that we muſt kneele at prayer, and therefore prayer being ioyned with the celebration of the Sacrament, &amp; not excepted, we muſt alſo kneele at the receiuing of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> So this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is the laſt that ſpeakes for ſtanding at prayer, and that by way of exception: for <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſaith nothing to the purpoſe: and therefore there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing 300. yeeres from this Councell to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Honorius,</hi> it is very probable, that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at Prayer was receiued long before <hi>Honorius,</hi> the third his time: And kneeling at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is as old, as the eldeſt witneſſe produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as I preſume ſhall appeare in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that enſue.</p>
               <p>I come now to this mans <hi>Verbum grande,</hi> his great and grand, and lowd word, that I ſay no
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7137:90"/>more of it; that is, that vntill <hi>Honorius</hi> the third (about the yeere 1120.) made a decree for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the Sacrament, the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiued ſtanding, and not kneeling: And kneeling is Antichriſtian, brought into the Church for the adoration of their Breaden god, in honour of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> and (as hee calls it) <hi>Real preſence:</hi> which opinion was firſt hatched by <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> and then foſtered by <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. and now honored by <hi>Honorius</hi> the third. I would this man had ſtudied his Maſters, <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> a little better, hee would peraduenture haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great difference, betweene <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>Reall preſence:</hi> and no leſſe then <hi>Inter rem ipſam, &amp; modum rei,</hi> betweene the thing it ſelfe, and the manner of doing of it. And ſurely <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> doe allow a true and <hi>Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> if I vnderſtand them; that is, that we in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> receiue the true Bodie and Blood of Chriſt: which all antiquitie doe collect out of Chriſts wordes; This is my Bodie, This is my Blood. But they renounce this new found man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by way of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> found out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Berengarius:</hi> whereby they thought to quench the flame that was then kindled, but it was <hi>Igne maiori,</hi> they put out the leſſer, with a greater fire, and not onely filled their bookes with a number of curious, idle, and philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call queſtions; and ſo corrupted diuinitie with philoſophie, but alſo for this new fangle of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> and the maintenance of the Popes vaſt and vnlimited tranſcendent power, made
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7137:90"/>the rent, and diuiſion of the Church vncureable, deſperate, and paſt all hope: becauſe the Popes will neuer renounce and diſclaime their bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ambition; and the Schoole will neuer giue ouer to adore this their Idol of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which the more they labour to make plaine, the further they inuolue themſelues with a world of difficulties: Which no doubt is the occaſion, that moſt of the wiſe and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Papiſts, who ſee how great euill hath fallen to the Church by it, and how much blood hath bene ſhed in the cauſe, doe wiſh in their hearts, though perchance they dare not profeſſe it, that the decree had neuer bene decreed.</p>
               <p>In which aſſertion, I take it, this man is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably deceiued, and would deceiue others. For I take it to be plaine, that kneeling and adoration, was not brought into vſe by Tranſubſtantiation, but rather Tranſubſtantiation was collected out of the Adoration and kneeling, that was vſed in the receiuing of the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> as I ſhall ſhew by and by out of <hi>Algerus,</hi> who inferreth Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, out of kneeling and Adoration. As for <hi>Honorius</hi> decree, I doe not finde kneeling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly named in it. <hi>Sacerdos frequentèr doceat ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem ſuam, vt cum in celebratione Miſſarum eleuatur hostia ſalutaris, ſe reuerentèr inclinet:</hi> Let the Prieſt often teach his people, that when in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Maſſe, the healthfull Hoſt is eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they bow themſelues reuerently. The word is, reuerent bowing, not kneeling; and it is to be done at the eleuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not at the receiuing. I could
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7137:91"/>wiſh that the whole decree were to be ſeene, for then ſomewhat would be manifeſt, that now is obſcure. But the firſt words of the Chapter, <hi>Sane cum olim,</hi> do imply ſomewhat more ancient: and it is very probable, that <hi>Honorius</hi> did not make a new decree, and eſtabliſh a new forme of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Sacrament, neuer vſed before, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane and confirme an old, which was bowing or kneeling; and peraduenture in particular, to deſigne in ſpecial, when it ſhould be done, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the eleuation. And it is moſt certainely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that ſome hundred yeeres before this <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was borne, the Deacon did call at the Maſſe, <hi>Flectamus genua,</hi> Let vs kneele; ſo that kneeling, and bowing was generally in vſe before, but ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation was vnknowne to the Fathers: and after it had gained ground, and began to be in requeſt, then this decree of <hi>Honorius</hi> did honour that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action of eleuation, with a reuerent bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by thoſe perchance which receiued it not: which doeth no way prooue, that kneeling was not vſed before <hi>Honorius</hi> time, but rather thoſe three words, ſet before the decree, doe lead vs to apprehend that ſome reuerence, and humilitie of bowing, or kneeling was anciently in vſe; out of which practiſe or pretence of antiquitie, <hi>Honorius</hi> did ground his decree. And it is a groſſe <hi>non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur</hi> to inferre thus: <q>
                     <hi>Honorius</hi> made a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that at the eleuation of the Hoſt, men ſhould reuerently bow themſelues: Therefore before this decree, men did not receiue the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> with reuerent bowing or kneeling.</q> For
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7137:91"/>they might, and did kneele at receiuing the Communion, in the times of the ancient fathers, and yet this eleuation, and circumgeſtation of the Sacrament, be but a new deuiſe, that made way to much ſuperſtition and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Now, although it bee hard to finde out the beginning of euery outward geſture, vſed in the worſhip of God, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, yet as it falleth out with the ſhadow on the Diall, we diſcerne it not moouing, but we eaſily diſcerne, that it hath mooued; So we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily diſcerne and point out the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this geſture, of kneeling in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> though after it hath paſſed ſome lines and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of time, we may eaſily diſcouer by the later vſe and cuſtome, that it fetcheth his pedegree from the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolicall men.</p>
               <p>The Fathers of the firſt age, being in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall conflict with perſecutors without, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks within, had little leyſure to delineate and deſcribe euery geſture they vſed in the Liturgie: yet ſurely they that ſo ſtrictly required an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and probation of our ſelues, contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and compunction, and prayer, and praiſe, and almes, and humilitie, and reuerence in this part of the worſhip of God, in ſuch ſort, that they held none to come worthily, nor bee admitted to the Lords Supper, but thoſe that vſed this probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preparation of themſelues, though their words ſpeake not of kneeling, yet their reaſons doe enforce it. And the very diſcerning the Lords body, did require as well an outward, as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7137:92"/>an inward difference, betweene the Lords Table, and other common tables: and therefore an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward geſture beſeeming the preſence of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, which muſt be ſutable to the greateſt humilitie, and that muſt needs be kneeling. And therefore this Author that ſpeaketh, and writeth ſo tediouſly againſt kneeling, is forced to daſh out all humilitie, and reuerence in his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, leſt if he had granted humilitie, hee muſt alſo haue bene forced to admit kneeling, the moſt proper and ſignificant geſture of humilitie.</p>
               <p>Now, as all the Fathers, cited by this Author, that ſpeake for ſtanding at prayer, are cleare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt ſitting, which he maketh eſſentiall, as being vſed in the firſt inſtitution; and moſt of their reaſons are for kneeling: ſo many of them, as alſo many others, ſpeake manifeſtly for ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and kneeling.</p>
               <p>To omit then, that at the deliuering of the Law of the Paſſeouer,
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> the people <hi>Incuruatus ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauit,</hi> bowed themſelues and worſhipped; and Chriſt the true Paſſeouer,
<note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note> in his Agonie before his Paſſion, fell on his face, and <hi>flexis genibus ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit,</hi> praied on his knees: I come to the Authors.</p>
               <p>And, to ſay no more of <hi>Iustin Marten,</hi> it is cleare that his words are againſt ſitting: <hi>Post haec ſurgimus communitèr omnes, &amp; preces profundimus;</hi> theſe things added, we all ariſe and pray. There it is manifeſt, they left ſitting.</p>
               <p>I come to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who is moſt reſolute for ſtanding at prayer:
<note place="margin">De oratione.</note> for he ſaith, <hi>Nefas ducimus, we hold it vnlawfull to kneele at prayer on Sundaies,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7137:92"/>
                  <hi>it is irreuerent to ſit in the ſight, and before the face of him whom thou doest reuerence and honour, how much more is that action most irreligious (to ſit) in the ſight of the liuing God, the Angel of Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, vnleſſe we will exprobate to God that our prayers haue wearied vs?</hi> If <hi>Tertullian</hi> will haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and humilitie at prayer to God, whom we moſt reuerence and honour, why ſhould hee not more require it at this Sacrament, which is the greateſt and moſt eminent part of Gods worſhip?</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Tertullian</hi> that ſpeakes ſo boldly for ſtanding at prayer, doth require kneeling at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: for ſpeaking of the ſet dayes of Baptiſme,
<note place="margin">De Baptiſm. in fine.</note> as Eaſter day, hee ſaith, <hi>Caeterùm omnis dies Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niest, omnis hora, omne tempus habile Baptiſmo: ſi de ſolennitate interest, de gratia nihil refert. Ingreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuros Baptiſmum orationibus crebris, ieiunijs, &amp; geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culationibus, &amp; peruigilijs orare oportet, &amp; cum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsione omnium retro delictorum, vt exponit etiam Baptiſmum Ioannis: tingebantur, inquiens, confiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes delicta ſua:</hi> Euery day is the Lords day, euery howre, and euery time is fit for Baptiſme, though there be difference of ſolemnitie, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of grace: they that are to bee baptized, muſt pray, with often prayers, and faſtings, and <hi>kneelings</hi> and watchings, and with confeſsion of all their ſinnes paſt, as <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme ſhewes; they were baptized confeſsing their ſinnes. So it is apparent by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that they which ſtood at praier on Eaſter day, the moſt ſolemne day, the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, they kneeled at
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7137:93"/>Baptiſme. And if they came to baptiſme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing their ſinnes, they ought to come to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with the like confeſsion of their ſinnes: for there is as great neceſsitie of confeſsion of ſinnes in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as in Baptiſme; as confeſsion auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar was more enioyned before the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> then before Baptiſme: And there was greater reaſon of kneeling at the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> then at Baptiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee come neerer to Chriſt in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of encreaſe, then in the other of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And all the Ancient thinke, that at his comming hee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe in bodie, as <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Seleucia</hi> ſayd; <hi>Vidi Centurionem ad pedes Domini prouolutum,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Centurion fallen at our Lords feete.

And in his booke of the Lords Supper, he commeth nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the point, <hi>Sacramento viſibili, ineffabilitèr diuinaſe infundit eſſentia, vt eſſet religioni circa Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenta deuotio;</hi> The diuine eſſence doeth inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fably infuſe it ſelfe into the viſible Sacrament, (though our Tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiators know the maner of it) that Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue deuotion about the Sacrament. Deuotion is ſometimes the inward Adoration of the heart, but in Gods ſolemne worſhip, outward Adoration is required with it. And againe, hauing deſcribed the ſighes,
<note place="margin">Num. 13.</note> and groanes, and teares of thoſe that come to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, he ſaith, <hi>Gemitus illos pietas excitat,</hi> it is pietie that ſendeth forth thoſe ſighes: and after, <hi>Inter data &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>donata ſe diuidens,</hi> affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuiding it ſelfe, between graces giuen, and ſins forgiuen, <hi>Fletibus ſe abluit, &amp; lachrimis ſe baptizat,</hi> waſheth it ſelfe with weeping, and baptizeth it ſelfe with teares. Is not this the very higheſt, or rather the loweſt of humilitie? And why ſhould not the body bee as humble in kneeling,
<note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> as the ſoule in teares? And then he addeth, <hi>Pauperes ſpiritu eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, &amp; diligit Spiritus ſanctus, &amp; eorum, qui pompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticè &amp; glorioſe ſacris ſe Altaribus ingerunt, obſequia detestatur,</hi> The holy Ghoſt chooſeth thoſe that are humble in ſpirit to this myſterie, &amp; he loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Is it not to come proudly without humilitie? For I muſt leaue the ſchoole of diuinitie, if I doe admit any <hi>medium,</hi> betweene Theologicall contraries: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man either humbleth himſelfe, or exalteth himſelfe: euery man commeth to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either pompouſly &amp; gloriouſly without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, as if hee were coheire, and coequall with Chriſt, or elſe humbly in all humiliation of ſoule and body. And though the holy Ghoſt know the ſecrets of all hearts, becauſe he is God, yet no man can know the heart of another man, and therefore wee muſt iudge them to come pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and braggingly that will not kneele, but will ſit, as equall with the eternall God, without all outward humilitie, when they are but duſt and aſhes. Againe, in the 17. Num. <hi>Ad haec intra ſacra myſteria ad gratiarum actionem conuertitur, &amp; inclinato capite, munditia cordis adepta, ſe intelligens conſummatum restitutus peccator, ſanctificat am Deo animam, quaſi depoſitum cuſtoditum fidelitèr reddit:</hi> After in the ſacred myſteries, the ſoule turneth to thankeſgiuing, and bowing the head; the reſtored ſinner hauing gotten pureneſſe of heart, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth himſelfe to be conſummated, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his ſanctified ſoule, as a thing committed and faithfully kept, vnto God.

                  <note place="margin">In Pſalme 98.</note> whoſe place is knowne to this Author, and he labours to elude it againſt the haire, as alſo he doeth <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> who vſeth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7137:99"/>the word of Adoration, as before you haue heard. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> expounding the words of the Pſalme, <hi>Adorate ſcabellum pedum eius,</hi> as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar readeth it, worſhip at his foot-ſtoole: or his foot-ſtoole; and alleadging the other Pſalme, <hi>Heauen is his Throne, and the earth his foot-ſtoole,</hi> and knowing that wee muſt <hi>worſhip the Lord our God, and ſerue him onely,</hi> he maketh a queſtion how we may worſhip the earth without Idolatry, and ſaith: <hi>Anceps factus ſum, timeo adorare terram, ne damnet me, qui fecit terram: Rursùs timeo non ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare ſcabellum pedum Domini mei, quia Pſalmus mihi dicit, Adorate Scabellum pedum eius. Quaero quid ſit Scabellum pedum eius, &amp; dicit mihi Scriptura, Terra ſcabellum pedum meorum: fluctuans conuerto me ad Christum, quia ipſum quaero hic, &amp; inuenio, quomodò ſine impietate adoretur terra; ſine impietate adoretur ſcabellum pedum eius: Suſcepit enim de terra terram; quia caro de terraeſt, &amp; de carne Mariae carnem acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit: Et quia in ipſa carne hic ambulauit; &amp; ipſam car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem nobis manducandam ad ſalutem dedit: nemo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem illam carnem manducat, niſi priùs adorauerit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentum eſt, quemadmodum adoretur tale ſcabellum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Domini, &amp; non ſolùm non peccamus adorando, ſed peccamus non adorando:</hi> I become doubtfull, I feare to adore the earth, leſt hee condemne mee that made the earth: Againe, I feare, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the foot-ſtoole of my Lord, becauſe the Pſalme ſaith to me, <hi>Adore his foot-ſtoole.</hi> I queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what is his foot ſtoole; and the Scripture ſaith to me, that the earth is his foot-ſtoole: wauering, I turne my ſelfe to Chriſt, becauſe I ſeeke him
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7137:99"/>heare, and I find how the earth may be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, without impietie, and his foot-ſtoole may be adored without impietie: For he tooke earth of earth, for fleſh is of the earth; and he tooke fleſh of the fleſh of the Virgin. And becauſe hee wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked here in the fleſh, and gaue that fleſh to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by vs to our ſaluation; and no man eateth that fleſh, vnleſſe he firſt haue adored, it is found out how ſuch a foot-ſtoole of the Lord may bee adored, and wee ſhall not onely not ſinne in ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but ſinne in not Adoring.</p>
               <p>In theſe words <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Sacrament; and he ſaith in effect, that the cuſtome, and geſture was vniuerſall ouer all the world. <hi>Nemo manducat,</hi> no man eateth that fleſh, but firſt hee Adoreth: not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the fleſh of the Sonne of God, which without reaſon, our Aduerſaries wreſt to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the Sacrament. But this muſt not be omitted, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, That it was ſo farre from ſinne to Adore the fleſh of Chriſt, that it was ſinne not to Adore it: ſo the omiſſion of this Adoration, or kneeling is a ſinne in <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> iudgement. And <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of all Adoration, ſpirituall, and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, externall, and internall, for elſe we may deny ſpirituall Adoration, as wel as externall in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> and that this Author doeth acknowledge; and then I marueile he can deny corporall, where he granteth ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>For why? May we worſhip, and adore God at the receiuing of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> with our hearts,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7137:100"/>and refuſe to worſhip him with our bodies, and our knees? If we giue him our hearts and ſpirits, ſhall wee deny him any thing that the heart, and ſpirit doeth command? Shall wee giue him the greater, and better part of our ſelfe, (our Soule) and deny him the leſſe, the bowing of the knee? So, <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of Adoration in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne, and compleate worſhip of God, muſt bee vnderſtood of inward, and outward Adoration, when both may be giuen. Beſides, it is a friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exception that this man maketh; that what <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh of the fleſh of Chriſt, muſt be vnderſtood ſpiritually: <hi>Spiritualitèr intelligite quod loquutus ſum,</hi> vnderſtand that ſpiritually which I haue ſpoken; for hee particularly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it of the fleſh of Chriſt. <hi>Non hoc corpus quod videtis, manducaturi eſtis; You ſhall not eate this body which you ſee, nor drinke that Blood which the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers ſhall ſhed; I haue commended vnto you a certaine Sacrament, being ſpiritually vnderſtood, it ſhall quicken you, or giue life; and though it be neceſſary to celebrate it viſibly, yet notwithſtanding it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſibly vnderſtood.</hi> So <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that thoſe words of the fleſh of Chriſt, muſt bee ſpiritually vnderſtood; the fleſh, that is the fleſhly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding profiteth nothing: but though the fleſh be vnderſtood ſpiritually, yet there is no ſyllable, that the Adoration ſhould bee onely ſpirituall. And becauſe I will not trouble my ſelfe with this mans dotage, it is his owne word, that Adoration muſt not alwayes meane kneeling, no more then the name Man, doeth ſignifie <hi>Socrates:</hi> Let him
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7137:100"/>giue mee a reaſon, why Adoration ſhould not ſignifie both inward deuotion and outward bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and kneeling, alwayes, except ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or neceſsitie doe reſtraine it onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip, when both inward and outward may, and ought to be tendered.</p>
               <p>But S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Text is plaine, for externall bowing, and kneeling: <hi>Ideo &amp; ad terram qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>libet cum te inclinas et proſternis: Therfore when thou doeſt incline, or bow downe, or cast downe thy ſelfe to the earth, behold it not as earth, but as that holy one, whoſe footeſtoole thou adoreſt, for him thou adoreſt.</hi> So <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſpeakes of ſuch adoration, wherin there is inclining, bowing downe or kneeling: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this geſture of kneeling was the vniuerſall cuſtome of the Communicants in S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time. I paſſe that ouer, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth cal this Sacrament, <hi>honorandum,</hi> honorable, as you may ſee in his 118. Epiſtle, <hi>ad Ianuarium. c.</hi> 3. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee wherein hee (yea, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his iudgement) placeth the abuſe of the Sacrament; <hi>Apoſtolus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignè dicit acceptum ab eis, qui hoc non diſcernebant à caeteris cibis veneratione ſingulariter debitâ:</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, that it was vnworthily receiued of them, who diſtinguiſh't it not from other meates, by yeelding it that worſhip which is eſpecially due to it.</p>
               <p>The tenth is <hi>Theodoret, Dial.</hi> 2. <hi>Neque enim ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna myſtica post ſanctificationem recedunt à natura ſua: manent enim in priori ſubſtantia, &amp; figura, &amp; forma, &amp; videri, &amp; tangi poſſunt, ſicut &amp; priùs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telliguntur autem ea eſſe quae facta ſunt, &amp; creduntur,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7137:101"/>&amp; adorantur, vt quae illa ſunt, quae creduntur:</hi> The myſticall ſignes after ſanctification, doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their nature, for they remaine in their former ſubſtance (there the ſubſtance of bread and wine remaines in the Sacrament) and figure, and forme, and may be ſeene and touched, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but they are vnderſtood to be thoſe things, which they are made, and are beleeued, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, as being thoſe things which they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued. So in <hi>Theodorets</hi> time there was adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the receiuing of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: for <hi>creduntur,</hi> they are beleeued, implies the inward (as this Author would make S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> to ſpeake) and then <hi>Adorantur,</hi> muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the outward, which doth conſiſt in the bowing, proſtration and kneeling of the bodie.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Dialogo</hi> 3. anſwering how a bodie might procure our ſaluation, he ſayth, Not the bodie of a man alone; but of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the onely begotten Sonne of God. And if that ſeeme ſmall and vile to thee, <hi>Quomodo eius typum, ac figuram venerabilem, ac ſalutarem exiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas? cuius autem typus est adorandus &amp; veneran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, quemadmodum eſt ipſum exemplar archetypum vile, &amp; aſpernandum?</hi> How doeſt thou eſteeme the type and figure of him to be venerable &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutiferous? for how is the Archtypal examplar, vile, and to bee deſpiſed, whoſe type is to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and worſhipped? Here it is cleere, that there was veneration, and adoration of Chriſt in the receiuing of the Sacrament; the very elements are ſacred, and dreadfull after conſecration; then
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7137:101"/>Adoration is not due to them, beeing creatures; but to Chriſt, whoſe fleſh is the type, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering or vaile of his Deitie.</p>
               <p>The 11. is <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus, Homil. in</hi> 2. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica poſt Epiphan.</hi> his words are: <hi>Quando vero ad Chriſti Sacramentum accedimus, &amp; fragilitatem noſtram conſideramus, quid aliud dicit vnuſquiſque noſtrum, niſinon ſum dignus vt intres ſub tectum; non ſum dignus vt corpus &amp; ſanguinem tuum ſuſcipiam in ore meo?</hi> when wee come vnto Chriſts Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſider our owne frailtie, what elſe doth euery one of vs ſay, but this; I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that thou ſhouldeſt enter vnder my roofe, I am not worthy to receiue thy bodie and blood in my mouth? He ſpeakes not plainly for knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but the opinion of the ancient is, that this Centurion, <hi>Prouolutus adpedes Domini,</hi> fell down, or kneeled at Chriſts feete, and then hee meant this acknowledgement to bee with kneeling. And, ſure I am, this teſtimony confounds this man, that denies any humilitie to bee vſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> for his confeſsion of his vnworthineſſe argues his humilitie, and his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie is the firſt linke, or moouer of kneeling: ſo hee that requires inward humilitie of ſoule, may well bee vnderſtood of outward humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bodie, in the publike, ſolemne and higheſt acte of Gods worſhip.</p>

And then the rule is, If it be a cuſtome of the Primitiue Church, the founder and Authour whereof is vnknowen; <hi>referendum eſt ad Apoſtolos,</hi> it muſt be aſcribed to the Apoſtles that vſed it in their times: And ſo it may well bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was not a late Antichriſt, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt in the Apoſtles and Apoſtolicall men, that firſt brought kneeling into the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in the receiuing of the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> For if the beginning and vſe were good; the abuſe, which is pretended for the aboliſhing of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was turned to Idolatrie, muſt bee refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and brought to the firſt inſtitution: as the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath done, which kneeles to God and Chriſt at the taking of this Sacrament, though wee vtterly deteſt the groſſe ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, that doe adore the Elements and <hi>ſpecies</hi> themſelues, if any bee found ſo palpably blinde: for the learned among them doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime

               <p>Now heare, I pray you, the force of this knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, how able it is to appeaſe wrath: <hi>Petrus Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſis</hi> ſaith of it; <hi>Nihil faciliùs frangit iram, quam genuflectio:</hi> nothing more eaſily breaketh anger, then kneeling, for it prouoketh him that ſuffers the iniurie to pardon, and him that doeth the iniurie it leadeth naturally to teares. For there is a certaine Sympathy, <hi>inter oculos &amp; genua,</hi> betweene the eyes, and knees: for, as they ſay that are skilfull in the nature of things, the child in the mothers wombe, <hi>oculos habet genibus ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitos:</hi> hath his eyes placed ouer his knees; and thence ſome thinke, that <hi>genua,</hi> the knees, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>à genis,</hi> of the cheekes that are ouer them, therefore the eyes naturally breake out into teares when wee kneele, as anſwering by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection <hi>tanquam collectaneis ſuis,</hi> as it were to thoſe with whom they were nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>But I will not ſay what it may be in man: ſure I am, if the Emperour <hi>Marcus</hi> his narration bee true, when he and his Armie were in diſtreſſe for want of water, and he had called the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in his Armie, to pray to their God to ſupply their extreame neceſsitie, the Chriſtians preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Proijcientes ſe in terram,</hi> caſting themſelues on the earth, fell to their prayers: and as ſoone as they had fallen to the earth, and called on God by prayer, the Lord ſent raine from heauen, that ſaued the Emperor and all his Army: there knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling procured a moſt gratious rayne: and ſo no

And if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw this; then in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time kneeling was the receiued geſture of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants at the Supper of the Lambe.

               <p>The perfection of the Triumphant Church impoſeth a neceſsitie of our imitation: if it bee done in heauen, it muſt be imitated on earth; if it

                  <hi>in obiecto,</hi> not <hi>in modo adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis:</hi> in the obiect of his adoration: For hee would haue giuen that to the Angel, which was peculiar only to God; but it was not in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his adoration: he fell at his feete and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him: diuine worſhip muſt haue falling downe, or proſtration, or kneeling, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip may not bee giuen to any Angell or Saint, or Sacred, or conſecrated Creature; but only to God, to whom onely it is due.</p>
               <p>The ſum therefore of this reaſon is ſhort, and punctuall: The Church Triumphant worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and feaſteth at the Lambes Supper, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or kneeling: Therefore the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, that muſt learne of the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, muſt worſhip with proſtration or knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7137:111"/>at the feaſt of the Supper of the Lambe. For the earth muſt learne of heauen: and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth ſuch guides, as the Saints in heauen, in the worſhip of God; it is to be feared that hee is turned ouer to worſe Tutors on earth: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he repent, and returne to the right way, and follow their footſteps that are gone to heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; he will hardly attaine to the great City, wherof they are admitted as Citizens and Saints: And ſure I am, the very <hi>Habendum</hi> and <hi>Tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi> the hauing, and holding, the right, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of our inheritance, is, as Chriſt ſaid: <hi>Vade &amp; fac ſimiliter;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 10.37.</note> goe, and doe thou likewiſe. They kneeled, and proſtrated themſelues, when they adored God; and were admitted to the feaſt of the Lambe on earth; they doe ſo, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, now in heauen; and they that reſt from all their labours, reſt not from this labour, of Adoration, and proſtration; and we muſt follow them in the way, that we may be crowned with them at the end of the way, in the Kingdome of glory.</p>
               <p>I Come now to the reaſons for ſitting, for the Authorities are for ſtanding. Now before I come to handle them in particular, giue mee leaue to ſtrike at the roote of them all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; and that is in ſhort, Pride, and Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You will maruell much, that I ſhould ſay, the Foundation of all theſe Reaſons is, Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Pride: and I cannot but maruell at it my ſelfe; but I muſt much more maruell at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7137:111"/>of theſe Reaſons; that bearing the name of a Chriſtian, and perchance a Miniſter, he ſhould giue mee cauſe to ſay as I doe: For I knowe no meane or <hi>medium</hi> in Theologicall contraries: when wee come to the Lords Table, either wee muſt be humble, or elſe we muſt bee preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and proud:
<note place="margin">Luk. 11.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that is not with mee is againſt mee,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>and hee that gathereth not with mee, ſcattereth.</hi> Either a good man, or a bad man; either faithfull, or vnfaithfull; either a good ſeruant, or a bad ſeruant; either borne of God, and the childe of God, or borne of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and the childe of the deuill: either wee doe righteouſneſſe, or wee doe vnrighteouſneſſe; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee loue the Brethren, or wee loue not the Brethren; either a good tree, and good fruit; or a bad tree, and bad fruit. And although a good tree cannot but beare good fruit, and a bad tree cannot but beare bad fruit; yet, <hi>Mala arbor fieri poteſt bona;</hi> a bad tree may bee made a good tree: and the change muſt be firſt <hi>in radice,</hi> and then <hi>in fructu:</hi> firſt in the Roote, wee muſt be grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; and then it will follow in the fruite. Yet in all theſe there is no meane; there is none to be found, but either he is good or bad: ſo there is none that comes to the Lords Table, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee is humble, and comes in humilitie with the Publicane, or elſe hee is preſumptuous,
<note place="margin">Luk. 18.10.</note> and comes in pride with the Phariſee.</p>
               <p>Now, that I may not bee accuſed to miſtake this Author, I will relate his words:
<q>
                     <hi>Kneeling is not onely diſagreeable with the ioyfull
<note place="margin">Pag. 85.</note>
                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:7137:112"/>carriage, which in the iudgement of the ſaid Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the ſolemnizing of the Lords day requireth throughout euery part of Diuine Seruice, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo repugnant in particular, to the perſon ſuſtained by each Communicant, and to the nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of the Lords Supper. The Lords Supper being a Sacrament; not of humbling our ſelues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner and guiſe of ſuppliants, and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries; but of ſpirituall feaſting and reioycing on our parts, not onely for the Lords Reſurrestion, and our owne, in his perſon, but for all other fauors and dignities, purchaſed for vs by his death.</hi> And Pag. 84. <hi>Kneeling, which is a geſture of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of him that bewrayeth his ſinnes, and ſubmiſsiuely ſueth for the pardon of them, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſutable, and repugnant to reioycing and cheerefulneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Good God, Is there any action of a Chriſtian, that may be done without humilitie? May man, that is but duſt and aſhes, preſent himſelfe at any time, in Gods ſight, without humilitie? That is, with Pride: for theſe admit no meane; either humble, or proud. May wee haue the affection of humilitie, and not haue the geſture of humilitie? Did not the Fathers that ſtood at their Prayers in honour of Chriſts Reſurrection, ſtand in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie? ſurely they ſtood in confidence of Gods grace, and in hope of their owne Reſurrection; but they ſtood in al humilitie, becauſe they could not forget their owne frailtie, confident in God, but humble in themſelues.</p>
               <p>So the Fathers that layd downe the geſture
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7137:112"/>of humilitie, for a particular Reaſon, did neuer lay downe the affection of humility; becauſe that is againſt all reaſon, to ceaſe to be humble, when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Diſcite ex me, quia humilis,</hi> Learne of me, to be humble, and meeke: learne of mee, not to create the world, not to redeeme the world: not to feed fiue thouſand with fiue loaues, nor to feed the whole world with a few ſeeds; not to raiſe from the dead, nor to keepe men that they die not, by curing all diſeaſes: but learne of mee to be humble, and meeke.</p>
               <p>And may it ſuffice to be humble in confeſſion of ſinne, and ſupplicating for pardon? or will it ſuffice to be humble in asking petitions, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of wants, and not bee humble in giuing of thanks? will it ſuffice to be humble in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our ſelues, and preparing our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to the Lords Table: and at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comming, &amp; receiuing, to ceaſe to be humble, and take ſtate vpon vs? Did we by our humilitie attaine to bee in a meaſure fit, and worthy for thoſe great myſteries, that ſo we may lay downe humilitie, and come <hi>Pompaticè, &amp; gloriosè,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyprian. de Caena Domin.</note> pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſly, and gloriouſly, as if we were haile-felow, and equall with God? No: It was humilitie that prepared vs to come to the Lords Table; and it muſt be humilitie that preſenteth vs at the Lords Table. And, <hi>Eadem ſunt principia constitutionis, &amp; conſeruationis;</hi> Humilitie was the firſt principle of Conſtitution, to make vs Chriſtians: and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie muſt bee the ſame principle of conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to keepe vs Chriſtians: and when we leaue
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7137:113"/>humilitie, we leaue to be Chriſtians: for humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is <hi>Proprium quarto modo:</hi> no Chriſtian with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humilitie: And therefore Chriſt ſaying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, <hi>Learne of me, for I am humble and meeke,</hi> ſaith vniuerſally, becauſe humilitie is neceſſary to Chriſtianitie; Learne of me to be humble in all actions of Chriſtianitie.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith not, Learne of me to be humble in the way, and to be proud, and preſumptuous in the end of the way: he ſaith not, Learne of me to be humble in confeſſion of ſinne, and then to be proud in confeſſion of praiſe: hee ſaith not, Learne of me to be humble in your priuat pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and bee proud at your prayers in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and corners of the ſtreets: hee ſaith not, Bee humble, and come by weeping Croſſe in your preparation to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and then be proud, and preſumptuous at the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as if you were equall with Chriſt, coheires with Chriſt, and owed him no reuerence at his Table: No, the Leſſon is Catholicke and vniuerſall: Bee humble in all actions, and dueties of Chriſtianitie.</p>
               <p>And ſurely this Man neuer learned this Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Fathers, but doeth indeed father his vntrueth vpon them: For they neuer diſcerned kneeling, the geſture of humilitie, to be vnſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and repugnant with reioycing and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: their ſtanding at Prayer was as full of humilitie, as of Ioy, and cheerefulneſſe; and they well knew, that reioycing was ioyned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, As it is in the 2. <hi>Pſalme, Exultate cum tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> ſo they reade it, <hi>Reioyce to him with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:7137:113"/>They knew, Abraham that feaſted the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or the Sonne of God, did adore them; And yet his feaſt was not without Ioy. And had this man read, and obſerued the Fathers well, hee ſhould haue found, that they neuer thought hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie it ſelfe, or the geſture of humilitie, to bee vnſutable, and repugnant to the Ioy of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> ſaith, that we muſt come, <hi>Cum lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis nectareis, &amp; ſuſpirijs contemplationis;</hi> with teares, ſweeter then Nectar, and ſighes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: <hi>Fletibusſe abluendo, lachrymis ſe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizando,</hi> waſhing and baptizing our ſelues with teares. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, we muſt come, <hi>Cum ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more &amp; tremore, &amp; horreſcendo,</hi> with feare, and trembling, and a certaine horror. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cum cordis contritione &amp; lachrymarum fonte,</hi> with contrition of heart, and a fountaine of teares: with a deuout heart, with feare, with reuerence and trembling, with chaſtitie of body, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſoule. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cum veneratione ſingularitèr debitâ,</hi> with ſingular veneration, with adoration, and proſtration, and kneeling, as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> and many others of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeake. Wee muſt come confeſſing our ſelues to be ſinners, with feare, and a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, with feare and compunction of heart, with humbled bodies, and contrite ſoules, with due reuerence and vigilancie; and many the like phraſes, moſt common in their writings, as the Reader may in part ſee in the fift Reaſon.</p>
               <p>I hope all theſe phraſes proue ſufficiently,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7137:114"/>that the Fathers no way thought the geſture of humilitie, to be altogether vnſutable or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to the Ioy and cheerefulneſſe of the gueſts at the Lords Table. They knew well ynough, that this is a Sacrament of humbling our ſelues, after the guiſe and maner of ſuppliants, and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries, though it were a ſpirituall Feaſt, and reioycing. For the more humble we are in ſoule and body, when we come to this Feaſt, the more Ioy we ſhall haue in our ſelues: Ioy in the Feaſt of God, and the participation of the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, and an encreaſe of Ioy, becauſe wee haue encreaſed our ſorrow, and contrition for our ſinnes paſt, and ſent vp our ſighes, and teares to procure our pardon, and acceptation of our ſelues, our ſoules, and bodies, to be liuing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, holy, and acceptable to him, which is our reaſonable ſeruice of him; and the greater was our ſorrow, the greater is our Ioy, for the treaſure that is ſought in ſorrow, is found with Ioy:
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.44.</note> and the bleſſed Virgin, &amp; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> that ſought <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſorrowing, found him with Ioy in the Temple.
<note place="margin">Luke 2.48.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But why doe I trouble my ſelfe, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with this vn-Chriſtian doctrine, that exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all humilitie of ſoule, and humiliation of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, from the Feaſt of the Lords Supper? Surely I make this one vſe of it; that I preſume, if the words of this Author were well obſerued, by all his abſurd fauourers, and followers, they would renounce that prophane or ciuill geſture of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which daſheth out one of the moſt glorious
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7137:114"/>and eminent vertues of Chriſtianitie, that is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, out of the greateſt, and principall part of Gods worſhip, that is the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly the more humble it is, the more acceptable it is in the ſight of God, and bringeth in ſtead thereof, that ſame Luciferian Pride, that was ſo odious in Satan, that preſumed to ſay,
<note place="margin">Eſay 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Sedebo in monte testamenti,</hi> I will ſit vpon the Mount of the Congregation: O thou impudent Lucifer,
<note place="margin">Bern. Serm. de S.

Caſt downe thy ſelfe then, O thou miſerable ſoule, at the feet of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> that thou mayeſt ceaſe to be miſerable: and bow thy knees to him,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.10.</note> to whom all knees are bowed, of things in heauen, in earth, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth; and know, that all Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues without humilitie, can neuer make vp the wedding garment, without which thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ſuffered to abide at the marriage Feaſt, but be caſt out into outward darkenes, where is wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt Reaſon is <hi>Ius cohaeredis,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ratio </seg>1</label> the right of a coheire: wee are Sonnes, not ſeruants: and not yonger Brethren, but heires; and heires of God, not of man; and coheires, or ioynt heires with Chriſt: and heires muſt take their place, and right vpon them, and ſit as coheires with Chriſt. But this man had forgotten the Text:
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.1.2.</note> The heire ſo long as hee is a childe differeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7137:115"/>from a ſeruant, but is <hi>ſub Tutoribus,</hi> vnder Tutors and gouernours, vntill the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Father. Surely, though wee haue put off the beggerly rudiments of the world, and bee Sonnes of grace, and no ſeruants of the world; and haue put away <hi>diſciplinam naturae &amp; legis,</hi> the diſcipline of nature, and <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of ſeruitude and feare: yet wee haue not put away <hi>Diſciplinam Euangelij &amp; charitatis,</hi> the diſcipline of the Goſpel of charitie. Chriſtians are vnder the diſcipline of charitie, as well as <hi>Iewes</hi> were vnder the diſcipline of the Law: and we haue Tutors and gouernours in the Goſpel, as well as they had in Nature, &amp; in the Law: And ſo, as we are the ſonnes of God, ſo alſo we are the ſeruants of God: not <hi>Serui timoris,</hi> but <hi>Serui cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.18.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; ſerui Iuſtitiae,</hi> not ſeruants by feare, but ſeruants by loue, and ſeruants of righteouſneſſe, and bound to the Lawes of Loue, and the Lawes of Children; And then, as children, when they aske a bleſſing of their fathers, they kneele; ſo we, when we aske pardon, or grace, and chiefly when we aske the greateſt grace, that is Chriſt, in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> we muſt kneele.</p>
               <p>And ſuppoſe we be <hi>Cohaeredes,</hi> coheires, ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires, or heires annexed with Chriſt, yet we are not <hi>aquales,</hi> equals to Chriſt, that wee ſhould ſit with him: for our part commeth farre ſhort of Chriſts part. Doeth this Author thinke, that we are equall to Chriſt in grace, when hee receiued the Spirit without meaſure,
<note place="margin">Pſalm. 45 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Praeconſortibus,</hi> and <hi>Pro conſortibus:</hi> aboue, and for his fellowes; and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7137:115"/>we in a ſcant meaſure? or ſhal we be equal to him in glory, who ſitteth at the right hand of God?</p>
               <p>Beſides, Chriſt, <hi>Quà homo,</hi> is <hi>Cibus:</hi> as man, he is the meat of this Feaſt; and <hi>Quà Deus,</hi> as God, he is the maker of the Feaſt: and though there may be ſome colour of equalitie, <hi>Quà homo,</hi> as he is a man; yet, as God, there can be no equalitie, nor proportion at all. So, though wee may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the meate we receiue, the fleſh of Chriſt, yet wee can neuer be equall to the Maſter of the Feaſt, that is, the Deitie of Chriſt, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And therefore though our Coheireſhip may giue vs ſome boldneſſe, in reſpect of Chriſts humanitie, yet our vileneſſe, in reſpect of his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhould caſt vs downe as low as the earth, when wee thinke that duſt and aſhes, is admitted to the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>And the Coheires that we now ſpeake of, are but coheires <hi>inſpe,</hi> in hope: but the Coheires <hi>in re,</hi> in deed, and in poſſeſſion, the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heauen, that feed at the Supper of the Lambe without all Sacraments, they doe fall downe or kneele, and worſhip him, that ſitteth vpon the Throne, and the Lambe, &amp; caſt downe their Crownes before the Throne. Wee haue onely <hi>Ius adrem,</hi> a right to our inheritance, but are out of poſſeſſion; the Saints haue <hi>Ius inre,</hi> right in the inheritance, that is right and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo: and yet they kneele. So the Saints in glory are humble, and fall downe or kneele, and worſhip: and the Saints in hope are proud, and ſitte; as if they were equall with God, to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7137:116"/>whoſe Table they are admitted.</p>
               <p>Beſides, this Argument is drawne from the common place of all ſects; that is Pride. Now conſider whither it tends; for it trenches deepe, and reaches almoſt to Arianiſme, to deny all worſhip to Chriſt. For the Propoſition being generall, will beare many Concluſions:
<list>
                     <item>We come to the Lords Table as Coheires with Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> wee muſt not knele nor humble our ſelues to Chriſt.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>We come to Gods worſhip as Coheires with Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Wee may not worſhip, or pray to Chriſt, he is but our Coheire.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For if we may pray to him, and worſhip at all times, and in all places; then wee may kneele to him at all times, and in all places; and ſo at the Lords Table. And if wee giue him inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and worſhip, wee cannot deny him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Adoration, proſtration, and kneeling: So the Argument either denieth all worſhip to Chriſt; or elſe granteth kneeling at the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is not worthy to be called a Reaſon; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ratio </seg>2</label> for it is but a branch of the former. It is <hi>Certitudo Cohaeredum,</hi> the aſſurance of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heireſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Kneeling at the <hi>Eucharist</hi> croſſeth our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Coheireſhip with Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore we may not kneele at the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:7137:116"/>
               <p>And why doeth Kneeling croſſe our aſſurance of our Coheireſhip with Chriſt? For my part I know nothing, that more croſſeth the aſſurance of Coheireſhip with Chriſt, then Pride and an aſſurance without ground: And nothing doeth more aſſure the ſoule of a Chriſtian, in his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in heauen, then this humilitie. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and pride ouerthrowes all Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Chriſtian morall vertues, as appeareth in the Phariſee: and humilitie is <hi>Baſis &amp; funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> the baſe, or foundation of all Chriſtian vertues: and the deeper the foundation of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is, (ſo it be ioyned with hope, and not with deſpayre) the more ſtrong and aſſured is the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that reacheth vp to heauen: ſo that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is vtterly falſe, That Kneeling, which is an Act of humilitie, doth weaken, or ſhake, or croſſe our aſſurance of Coheireſhip with Chriſt. For nothing doeth more ſtrengthen this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, then this inward humilitie, and deuotion of the heart, teſtified by the outward geſture of the Kneeling, and proſtration of the body.</p>
               <p>And no man can haue any aſſurance of his Coheireſhip that commeth not duely prepared by repentance, and contrition, by prayer, and prayſe, all which are odious in the ſight of God, if they be not ioyned with humilitie. For God hateth and abhorreth the prayer, and the thanks of the proud, and preſumptuous, their ſacrifices are abominable in his ſight:
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.5.</note> hee reſpecteth the humble, and reſiſteth the proud.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe Iudas did ſit at the Lords ſupper, at
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7137:117"/>the firſt inſtitution: what aſſurance of Coheire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had he? The Fathers and Chriſtians in the Primitiue Church, as appeareth by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies cited in the fift Reaſon; did adore, and kneele at the receiuing of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> what did their kneeling croſſe their aſſurance of Coheireſhip with Chriſt? Nay, did not their humilitie and kneeling increaſe their aſſurance? this falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple then muſt neceſſarilie produce a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, like vnto it ſelfe: For kneeling doeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs, not to an apprehenſion of disfellowſhip, but rather of fellowſhip (if that be not too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar) and vnitie with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As for that profane word,
<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> that kneeling doeth import <hi>ſubiection and disfellowſhip with Chriſt, and the perſon of a gueſt and Coheire doeth import equae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and ſocietie with him;</hi> and therefore it is not to be vſed in the receiuing of the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> it is a moſt odious ſpeech, becomming a Phariſee, better then a Chriſtian: for though we haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt, yet wee ſhall neuer haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie with him, neither in this life, nor in the life to come: there may be equalitie in nature, as hee is a man; but there can neuer bee equalitie in the endowme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, either of nature, grace, or glory.

               <p>All this Reaſon is drawen from the rules of Tables, and Feaſts amongſt men: wherein this man is as groſſe and carnall, as in the two former Reaſons hee was abſurd, and ſmelt of <hi>Arianiſme.</hi>
                  <q>A ciuill Sympoſiarch admits all his gueſts to ſit with him at his Table; therefore all muſt ſit with Chriſt at his Table.</q> This is the force of this Argument; as if hee ſhould ſay: Chriſt is tied to the rule of ordinarie Feaſt-makers, and muſt doe as they doe. It is a Table, and a Feaſt, and they are gueſts; and therefore all liberties, and prerogatiues of a Table, and a Feaſt, and gueſts; and ſo ſitting, equalitie, and ſociety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humilitie and ſubiection, is due vnto them, as their libertie and prerogatiue.</p>
               <p>The word of the Apoſtle was neuer truer then in this caſe:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Animalis homo non percipit ea quaeſunt Dei:</hi> this carnal man vnderſtands not the things of God: For what greater ignorance can there be, then out of the faſhion of Tables, and geſtures of gueſts at Feaſts amongſt men, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a neceſſary Concluſion, That becauſe the Lord hath a Table, and admits gueſts to that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7137:118"/>Table; therefore men may demeane themſelues with like geſture at Gods Table, as they doe at the feaſts of men.</p>
               <p>But this man might haue remembred that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is as well called <hi>Sacrificium,</hi> and <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Dei,</hi> as <hi>Caena;</hi> a Sacrifice, and the worſhip of God, aſwell as a Supper: and then Kneeling, and Proſtration, and Adoration, are more fitter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures for ſacrificers, and worſhippers, then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is for gueſts at the Table of the Lord of all power and Maieſtie.</p>
               <p>And therefore as in <hi>S.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.21. Heb. 13.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> there is <hi>Menſa Domini;</hi> the Table of the Lord. So there is, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus altare:</hi> wee haue an Altar, whereof they haue no right to eate which ſerue the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. And the word Altar in the Fathers, is more common then the word Table: ſo that as the name of Table may pleade for ſitting; ſo the name of Altar enforceth worſhip, and Sacrifice, and that implieth Adoration and Kneeling.</p>
               <p>But his grand error is, that hee inferreth, that the geſture, vſed by gueſts at the feaſt, or table of a man, is, and muſt bee eſſentiall at the Lords Table. For why? Suppoſe the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch or King, ſhould feaſt the meaneſt of his Subiects, and admit him to ſit at his Table, is it an Argument <hi>à pari;</hi> to conclude therefore, <hi>Wee must ſit at the Table of the Lord?</hi> why then will it not follow thus? The King ſuffers his ſubiect to ſit at his Table with him couered, or his Hat on, (for this is one of the liberties &amp; prerogatiues of a table, and vſed ordinarily at all great feaſts)
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7137:119"/>therefore we muſt come, and ſit couered, or our Hats on our heads, at the Table of the Lord. But the true difference is this; The King and the Subiect, though different <hi>inſtatu,</hi> in ſtate; the one is to gouerne, as Gods Vice-Roy; the other to bee gouerned: and the King hath power of life and death ouer his Subiect, according to Iuſtice and Law; yet they are equall in nature and condition; both men, created according to one ſtampe or Image, the Image of God; both borne by one way of generation; both liuing, and dying after one faſhion; and the graue knowes no difference betweene the aſhes of the King, and his meaneſt vaſſall. And they are equall in grace, both bought with one price, the blood of Chriſt; both regenerate in one Lauer of Baptiſme; both ſanctified by one holy Spirit; both fed with one and the ſame bread, the Word of God, and the fleſh and blood of Chriſt; both equall in hope of eternall glory: ſo there is inequality in one thing, that is, in ſtate; but there is equalitie in three for it, that is, in Nature, Grace, and Glory.</p>
               <p>But betweene God, euer bleſſed, and euer to bee adored; and man, whoſe greateſt bleſsing is to bee admitted, euer to bleſſe, and adore God, there is no equalitie at all: For it is proper only to the eternall Sonne of Gods owne ſubſtance, to be <hi>aequalis Deo ſine rapina;</hi> equall to God without robbery. Men are called Gods, but they are Gods onely in name,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Dixi Dijeſtis;</hi> I haue ſayd, yee are Gods;
<note place="margin">Iob 10.34, 35.</note> becauſe the word of God was ſent to them; and can neuer be equall to God; and it is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7137:119"/>groſſe ſaeriledge, that any man who is a God by grace, or name onely, ſhould account himſelfe Gods equall, or fellow, as this man doth account himſelfe, &amp; all his coheires to be equal to Chriſt: For God and man doe differ infinitely, becauſe God is infinite, and man is finite; and betweene eternitie &amp; mortalitie, the Creator and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there can bee no compariſon, at all.</p>
               <p>And in this Sacrament, Chriſt as man is our food, and Chriſt as God, and the whole Trinitie, doe giue this food: yea Chriſt, not onely <hi>Qua ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> but alſo <hi>Qua homo mortuus,</hi> not onely as he is a man, but alſo as he is dead for vs, is our food: and therefore this Sacrament doth repreſent, not <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> but <hi>mortem Christi,</hi> not the life, but the death of Chriſt; So Chriſt as man, doeth not make this Feaſt, but Chriſt as God maketh this feaſt, and Chriſt as man is the meate of this Feaſt. And though there were equalitie betweene Chriſt and vs, as he is man, and our elder Brother: yet betweene Chriſt, and vs, as he is God, there is no equalitie, but all ſubiection on our parts; and therefore all ſubmiſſion of ſoule, and body is to be tendered to him by vs, when wee come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his Fleſh and Blood. And it is a plaine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, and no good reaſon to inferre, Wee ſit at the Kings Table, therefore wee muſt ſit at the Lords Table. And therefore we may not claime that libertie, and prerogatiue at Gods Table, that we take at the tables of men, vnleſſe wee will flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſelues, that no more reuerence, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7137:120"/>and Adoration, and kneeling is due to God, then vnto man.</p>
               <p>The fourth Reaſon is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ratio </seg>4</label> it is, <hi>contra Ius naturae,</hi> 
                  <q>contrary to the Law of nature; Kneeling at a feaſt or banquet, is againſt the Law of nature: therefore it is vnlawfull to kneele at the Feaſt or Supper of the Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here I would bee glad to know where this Law of nature is written, or to bee found. If by the Law of nature hee vnderſtand the Morrall Law, I finde bowing downe, or kneeling, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there in the worſhip of God.
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.5.</note> Thou ſhalt not bow downe to them, (that is to Idols) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt bow downe, or kneele to God. For where the one contrary is forbidden, there the other contrary is commanded. And this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a principall part of Gods worſhip; If he meaneth the naturall Law, found out by the light of naturall Reaſon,
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.3.</note> then <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Wiſe-men,
<note place="margin">Matt 2.11.</note> worſhipped God with proſtration or kneeling. If he meane the law of Nature, that is, the nature of the thing or action, <hi>Vt naturarei, ſit Lex naturae:</hi> that the nature of the thing, ſhould be the Law of Nature, then kneeling is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the nature of the action, or thing done, that is the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> For it is altogether an action of ſubiection, and humilitie, and therefore kneeling is moſt ſutable to it. It is <hi>Cultus Dei,</hi> the worſhip of God, and a moſt eminent and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of it. It is a Sacrifice commemoratiue:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7137:120"/>It is a Sacrifice of our ſelues, our ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: It is a Sacrifice of contrition offered by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiaries, a Sacrifice of Prayer, offered by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants; and kneeling is moſt fit for Sacrificers: It is the <hi>Eucharist</hi> or Sacrifice of praiſe: and in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> where it is often ſaid, That the Elders did fal downe &amp; worſhip, there is ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any prayer made for want, but honour, and glory, and praiſe for that which was receiued. So kneeling is moſt ſutable to Thankeſgiuing. And in this Sacrament wee receiue the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings at Gods hand, that this life is capable of; and the greater Gods graces be, the humbler ſhould wee be at the receipt of them: as men vſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the greateſt goodneſſe of Princes, vpon their knees.</p>
               <p>So that, beſides the practiſe of the Church in Heauen, and earth; all reaſon pleadeth for knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and all Reaſon pleadeth againſt ſitting. For what is more repugnant to the nature of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, of Sacrificers, of penitentiaries, of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants, of thankeſgiuers, then ſocietie, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and equalitie, and ſitting? ſo this Reaſon is well retorted.</p>
               <p>Sitting is repugnant to the nature of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, that worſhip, that ſacrifice, that are contrite, that are ſuppliants, and receiuers: therefore ſitting is not to be vſed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants at the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as being repugnant to the law of Nature, or naturall reaſon, or the nature of the thing, or action that is in hand.</p>
               <p>The fift Reaſon is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ratio </seg>5</label> It is <hi>Cultus priuatus in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico:</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:7137:121"/>Kneeling at the receipt of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> is a priuate worſhip, in the time and act of publicke worſhip: therefore kneeling is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>This Reaſon I vnderſtand not, or elſe it is falſe and friuolous: falſe; for it is vtterly vntrue, That it is vnlawfull to performe priuate worſhip, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time, and act of Gods publicke Seruice. As if he ſhould ſay, It is vnlawfull for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to make his priuate prayers, in the time of publicke prayers, for his owne wants and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; then, which nothing is more abſurd. For why?
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1.10.</note> was it vnlawful for <hi>Samuels</hi> mother to aske a ſonne of God in the Temple, in the time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and publicke worſhip? Or was it vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian,
<note place="margin">2. Reg. 5.18.</note> in the time of the publike idolatrous worſhip in the houſe of <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to make his petitions to the God of heauen? Was it vnlawfull for the Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Acts. 3.1.</note> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> to aſcend to the Temple at the hower of prayer, the ninth hower, and there worſhip and make their priuate petitions after the manner of Chriſtians, for their owne wants and neceſsities, in the time of the publike worſhip of the Iewes? Is it vnlawfull for the Preacher, in the time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and publike worſhip, to make his priuate prayer, for Gods aſsiſtance, in the diſcharge of his duetie in that worke?</p>
               <p>But the ſecret of this propoſition is; This man meant to make ſome ſhew or colour for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane faſhion of ſome of his Brethren, who in time of Diuine Seruice, come into their ſeates, and there ſquatt downe, and neuer vouchſafe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7137:121"/>once to kneele, or make any prayer to God; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence that they muſt ioyne in publicke worſhip and ſo neglect their owne priuate occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and duties.</p>
               <p>It is friuolous: For how can any worſhip bee called publicke, vnleſſe it be alſo the priuat wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the particular men there preſent? as the vniuerſall doth conſiſt of many particulars: Now this worſhip hath the name of publicke, becauſe it is performed by the particular men there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though peraduenture ſucceſsiuely, as the capacitie of the place will permit: As firſt the Miniſter kneeles, and receiues; then hee ſtands vp, and goeth, and deliuereth the Sacrament to the Communicants kneeling in order. It may be they do not all kneele together, becauſe they doe not all come together, but yet euery mans priuat kneeling, by ſucceſsion, maketh the publicke worſhip and adoration. And ſo, that this worſhip may be publicke and generall, it is neceſſary that euery man, by his owne priuat worſhip, doe make the whole Seruice, to be the publicke worſhip of God. And if by the priuat, there bee any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, or difference in the publicke worſhip of God: the fault is in thoſe refractary ſpirits, that out of the humor of contradiction, rather then reaſon, refuſe to kneele with the reſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; that ſo there may, neither be vnitie in heart, nor vniformitie in geſture in the Seruice of God.</p>
               <p>The 6. Reaſon is <hi>Seſsio, prior &amp; potior genuſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione:</hi>

                     <hi>Ratio</hi> 6.</note>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:7137:122"/>ſitting is more ancient, for it is the practiſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and it is better then Kneeling; therefore we muſt ſit at the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> and not kneele.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Prior tempore, potior iure,</hi> he that is firſt in time, hath the better right: This Reaſon ſtands on two grounds, Antiquitie, and goodneſſe. The firſt is doubtfull, and was neuer prooued, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſumed. The ſecond I take to bee plainely falſe: For the Antiquitie, I ſee little reaſon, for why? there is no record of Antiquitie for ſitting, produced ſince Chriſts time; &amp; therfore though it may haue a writ of right, yet I am ſure it hath beene out of poſſeſsion, euer ſince the Apoſtles times: and this Author cannot deny it, nor lay the fault vpon the reformed Church of England, for making an entry, and diſpoſſeſsing this ſitting at the Sacrament: For he proueth ſtanding at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and thereupon preſumes, ſtanding alſo at the Sacrament to haue beene a receiued cuſtome in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time. And I haue proued kneeling to bee in vſe in the Sacraments, in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time. So it was the Primitiue Church, that changed the old, and firſt, and beſt geſture at the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into a newer, and a worſe, if this man ſay true. Beſides, at the Paſchall ſupper <hi>Diſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebat,</hi> Chriſt ſate, or lay, and leaned with the twelue: but what hee did at the Euangelicall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it is not knowne: ſo the practiſe of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles is moſt imitable if it were known what it were. And <hi>Diſcumbebat,</hi> is not, he ſate, in the proprietie of the word and geſture, for then
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7137:122"/>Chriſt and his Apoſtles did breake the Law of ſtanding at the Paſſeouer: ſo the firſt part of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is doubtfull.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, of goodnes, is falſe: Sitting is not ſo decent, and comely a geſture for Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, that are worſhippers, and ſacrificers, and penitentiaries and ſuppliants, and prayſers, as Kneeling is. For kneeling is a geſture of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſubiection, and beſt ſuteth with Chriſtian pietie and deuotion: and ſitting is an action of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, and equalitie, which can neuer be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betweene the eternall God, and man that is mortall. Kneeling agrees well with Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and therefore beſt ſutes with Saints on earth: Therefore kneeling is the better geſture. So this Argument is partly doubtfull, and partly falſe.</p>
               <p>The 7. Reaſon is, <hi>Idololatria eſt:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here I obſerue a fine tricke, that is; that with this man, it is all one, to bow downe before a conſecrated creature, and to bow downe to a conſecrated creature. The firſt may be done, and was euer done, the ſecond may neuer bee done lawfully: For example, He that kneeleth at the Lords Table, at his prayers, or in a Temple, he boweth downe, <hi>Coram,</hi> before a conſecreated creature. The Prieſts in <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe before the Altar, and both Temple
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7137:123"/>and Altar were conſecrated. The high Prieſt once euery yeere entred into the Holieſt, and bowed before the Altar, the Mercie-ſeate, and the Cherubins: And the Tabernacle, and the Altar, and the Mercie-ſeat, and the Cherubins were conſecrated: yet none of theſe committed Idolatry therein; becauſe, though they bowed before conſecrated creatures, yet they bowed not to the conſecrated creatures; but to that God that ordained ſuch conſecrated places, and ſuch conſecrated creatures for the better performing of his owne worſhip and ſeruice.</p>
               <p>And if theſe Iewiſh Prieſts, and the high Prieſt, were not Idolaters, though they bowed before theſe conſecrated creatures; no more ſhall it bee Idolatrie in vs, to bow downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, before the conſecrated Bread and Wine, ſo long as wee giue no part of Gods worſhip to thoſe conſecrated creatures.</p>

               <p>And the trueth is, that God doth ſo farre foorth value conſecrated Temples, and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7137:123"/>and Tables, and Altars, that hee doth the better approoue, and receiue the Sacrifices, and Prayers, and prayſes of his people, onely in this reſpect; that they are offered <hi>in Templo,</hi> or <hi>verſus Templum;</hi> in the Temple, or towards the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: As no doubt God doth receiue our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more readily, becauſe they are made in the ſtile of heauen, in the wordes that Chriſt himſelfe taught, <hi>When you pray, pray thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is one thing to worſhip God in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated place, or before conſecrated creatures; &amp; it is another thing to worſhip, or giue any part of diuine worſhip vnto the conſecrated creature. And hee is a plaine Sophiſter, that ſhall argue thus:
<q>Wee may, or doe worſhip God in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecreated place, or before, or in the preſence of conſecrated creatures; therefore wee may, or doe worſhip the conſecrated place, or conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted creatures themſelues:</q> So this Author, in this Reaſon, doth make an aduerſary to himſelfe, and then ſhootes his arrowes at him, but neuer comes neere the practiſe of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that as reſolutely denies all Adoration of any conſecrated creature, as ſhee readily offers all diuine worſhip and adoration to God, to whom onely it is due.</p>
               <p>The 8. Reaſon is, <hi>Praxis Eccleſiae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7137:124"/>the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> therefore they ſtood at the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> ſo ſitting or ſtanding is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kneeling; which came in with <hi>Honorius</hi> 3. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree inhonour of their Breaden god.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is anſwered before in my firſt Reaſon, and there largely confuted: In which let theſe things neuer be forgotten: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, hee takes the Paſchall Supper for the Euchariſticall Supper; they ſate at the one, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>ergo,</hi> at the other. 2. Chriſt did not breake the Lawe of the Paſſeouer, which was to bee eaten ſtanding; and therefore <hi>Diſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebat,</hi> doth not inferre the geſture of ſitting, but onely the action of ſupping. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſpeake for ſtanding at prayers on Sundayes, and from Eaſter to Pentecoſt, ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſtanding at the Sacrament: and many of the ſame Fathers, with many others, prooue kneeling to bee in vſe at the receiuing of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> as ſtanding was at prayer. And there is kneeling vſed in diuine worſhip in heauen, by them that are admitted to the Supper of the Lambe. So the practiſe of the Church is for kneeling at the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and neuer for ſitting.</p>

               <head>CONCLVSIO.</head>
               <p>THus haue I, at large ſet downe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for Kneeling at the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and briefly refuted the Reaſons that are vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for ſitting, paſſing ouer many ſlight paſſages in them, that are of ſmall or no moment. Now it remaineth I ſay ſomewhat of the Authoritie by which this geſture of Kneeling is eſtabliſhed, and required in the Church of England. And ſurely the Prince and Prelates of this Church, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the reformation of ſuperſtitions and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, crept into the worſhip of God by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Poperie, according to ſome rule, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: and propoſed to themſelues, to goe by an euen way: that is, ſo to reforme, that they might withall reſtore the Church to her ancient puritie. In which reſpect they endeuoured to take away the multitude of idle, and ſuperfluous Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that made the ſtate of Chriſtianitie more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, then the ſtate of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was; and to retaine ſuch geſtures, and Ceremonies, which they found truely ancient and reaſonable.</p>
               <p>Their meaning was not to make a new Church; but to reforme according to the firſt, and primitiue, and Apoſtolicall inſtitution: for that which is firſt, that is true. Their purpoſe was not to take the crooked ſtaffe, and bow it ſo farre from one extreame to another, that from ſuperſtition, they would preſently decline to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7137:125"/>prophaneſſe: but thought it fit to make a ſtay in the golden meane, neither retayning all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, leſt Religion might ſeeme to be nothing elſe but externall pompe, and geſticulation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reiecting all, leſt Religion hauing loſt all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall maieſtie, might appeare naked, and ſoone decay at the heart.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe Ceremonies retained, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and Kneeling is one: as being ancienter then Popery, and fetching his pedegree from the firſt Fathers, and Martyrs in the Church, and grounded vpon good and ſufficient reaſon, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a duety to be performed by the body, in that eminent part of diuine worſhip, that is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as Deuotion and Pietie is the duety, which at that time is to be tendered by the ſoule. Either of which two, whoſoeuer will leaue out in the celebration of this holy myſterie, he muſt withall, ſtrike out all ſubiection, and humilitie out of this ſeruice; and come pompouſly, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſſy, and Phariſaically, as if hee were fellow, and equall with our bleſſed Sauiour, the eternall Sonne of God, and the bleſſed Trinitie, that is the Maker of this great Feaſt.</p>
               <p>For if Chriſt be God, why ſhould hee not be adored in his Word, in his Sacraments, in his Worſhip, and in all parts of Chriſtian duetie? And if the <hi>Iewes</hi> Synagogue had power to turne ſtanding, into ſitting at the Paſſeouer, as ſome thinke, (though I be not of their opinion) they did after the captiuity: why hath not the Church
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7137:125"/>of Chriſt power to change ſitting, or lying, and leaning into kneeling, which is the fitteſt geſture to repreſent ſubiection and humilitie?</p>
               <p>So the Church of England, reforming by the rule of the Primitiue Church, hath learned, and practiſed by her example, to proſtrate and kneele at the receipt of thoſe great and ſacred Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In which I diſpute not, whether it be a due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of neceſſitie, or a Ceremonie of indifferencie; I conceiue vpon reaſon, in mine owne Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is a duety, or part of Gods worſhip, not to be omitted in publicke and ſolemne Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but in caſe of euident neceſſitie. If any man take it to bee onely a Ceremony of in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, I wil not be contentious: ſure I am, if it be a duery, there is ſufficient power in the Church to declare it; and puniſh the refractary, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient. If it be a Ceremonie of indifferencie, there is ſufficient power in the Church, vpon good reaſon of decencie and order, to eſtabliſh it, and bring all her members in obedience to it.</p>
               <p>If there be not a power in the Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Articles of faith, and dueties of Religion, then will it be free for euery man, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule, to beleeue, and doe what he lift, no man ſhall haue power to correct him for his erroneous conſcience. If there bee not a power in the Church to inſtitute and reſtore Ceremonies of decencie and order, and to remooue vndecent, and diſorderly geſtures, then will it bee free for euery man to worſhip God after his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7137:126"/>and then, ſo many men, ſo many worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: and euery priuate man ſhall haue more power, then the whole Church hath, to inſtitute what Ceremonies he liſt, and then to be Lord Paramount, ſubiect to none, no not to the whole Church.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Caetera cum venero diſponam:</hi> the reſt I will diſpoſe when I come.

And ſomewhat he deliuered about Ceremonies, as of faſting, and eating before they came to the Lords Table; of the time, before, or after Supper; and the place, the Church, not the priuate eating houſe. There remained ſome other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, neuer deliuered by the Apoſtle, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Sacrament. In this, either the Church hath power to inſtitute, and eſtabliſh, as the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Councell did for ſtanding at Praier;

               </p>
               <p>So then, the Church that hath a power to inſtitute and eſtabliſh Ceremonies in matters of decencie and order, hath appointed this geſture of kneeling; that doth moſt fully expreſſe the ſubiection and humilitie of Communicants, of Worſhippers, of Sacrificers, of Penitents, of Suppliants, and of Prayſers, to bee fit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
